# Deep Learning Coursework

## Overview
This repository contains three deep learning tasks as part of the **CSC8637 Deep Learning with Project** coursework at Newcastle University. The trained model weights were removed to reduce file size. 

The coursework consists of three tasks:
1. CycleGAN Model for Human-to-Cat/Dog Style Transfer
2. Fine-Grained Image Classification of Bird Species
3. Word-Level Language Model for Text Generation

## Task Descriptions
### **Task 1: Using an Existing Model (CycleGAN)**
The goal of this task is to train a **CycleGAN model** to perform image style transfer between **human faces and cats/dogs**.

### **Task 2: Fine-Grained Classification**
This task involves training a deep learning model for **fine-grained bird species classification** using the **CUB-200-2011 dataset**.

### **Task 3: Word-Level Language Model**
Train a RNN model using text from **Agatha Christie's book, *Poirot Investigates***.
