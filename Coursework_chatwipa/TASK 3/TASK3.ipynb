looking out idly on\\nthe street below.\\n\\n“that’s queer,” i ejaculated suddenly beneath my breath.\\n\\n“what is, _mon ami_?” asked poirot placidly, from the depths of\\nhis comfortable chair.\\n\\n“deduce, poirot, from the following facts! here is a young lady,\\nrichly dressed—fashionable hat, magnificent furs. she is coming\\nalong slowly, looking up at the houses as she goes. unknown to her,\\nshe is being shadowed by three men and a middle-aged woman. they\\nhave just been joined by an errand boy who points after the girl,\\ngesticulating as he does so. what drama is this being played? is\\nthe girl a crook, and are the shadowers detectives preparing to\\narrest her? or are _they_ the scoundrels, and are they plotting to\\nattack an innocent victim? what does the great detective say?”\\n\\n“the great detective, _mon ami_, chooses, as ever, the simplest\\ncourse. he rises to see for himself.” and my friend joined me at\\nthe window.\\n\\nin a minute he gave vent to an amused chuckle.\\n\\n“as usual, your facts are tinged with your incurable romanticism.\\nthat is miss mary marvell, the film star. she is being followed by\\na bevy of admirers who have recognized her. and, _en passant_, my\\ndear hastings, she is quite aware of the fact!”\\n\\ni laughed.\\n\\n“so all is explained! but you get no marks for that, poirot. it\\nwas a mere matter of recognition.”\\n\\n“_en vérité!_ and how many times have you seen mary marvell on the\\nscreen, _mon cher_?”\\n\\ni thought.\\n\\n“about a dozen times perhaps.”\\n\\n“and i—once! yet _i_ recognize her, and _you_ do not.”\\n\\n“she looks so different,” i replied rather feebly.\\n\\n“ah! _sacré_!” cried poirot. “is it that you expect her to promenade\\nherself in the streets of london in a cowboy hat, or with bare\\nfeet, and a bunch of curls, as an irish colleen? always with you\\nit is the non-essentials! remember the case of the dancer, valerie\\nsaintclair.”\\n\\ni shrugged my shoulders, slightly annoyed.\\n\\n“but console yourself, _mon ami_,” said poirot, calming down. “all\\ncannot be as hercule poirot! i know it well.”\\n\\n“you really have the best opinion of yourself of anyone i ever\\nknew!” i cried, divided between amusement and annoyance.\\n\\n“what will you? when one is unique, one knows it! and others share\\nthat opinion—even, if i mistake not, miss mary marvell.”\\n\\n“what?”\\n\\n“without doubt. she is coming here.”\\n\\n“how do you make that out?”\\n\\n“very simply. this street, it is not aristocratic, _mon ami_! in\\nit there is no fashionable doctor, no fashionable dentist—still\\nless is there a fashionable milliner! but there _is_ a fashionable\\ndetective. _oui_, my friend, it is true—i am become the mode, the\\n_dernier cri_! one says to another: ‘_comment?_ you have lost your\\ngold pencil-case? you must go to the little belgian. he is too\\nmarvellous! every one goes! _courez!’_ and they arrive! in flocks,\\n_mon ami_! with problems of the most foolish!” a bell rang below.\\n“what did i tell you? that is miss marvell.”\\n\\nas usual, poirot was right. after a short interval, the american\\nfilm star was ushered in, and we rose to our feet.\\n\\nmary marvell was undoubtedly one of the most popular actresses on\\nthe screen. she had only lately arrived in england in company with\\nher husband, gregory b. rolf, also a film actor. their marriage\\nhad taken place about a year ago in the states and this was their\\nfirst visit to england. they had been given a great reception.\\nevery one was prepared to go mad over mary marvell, her wonderful\\nclothes, her furs, her jewels, above all one jewel, the great\\ndiamond which had been nicknamed, to match its owner, “the western\\nstar.” much, true and untrue, had been written about this famous\\nstone which was reported to be insured for the enormous sum of\\nfifty thousand pounds.\\n\\nall these details passed rapidly through my mind as i joined with\\npoirot in greeting our fair client.\\n\\nmiss marvell was small and slender, very fair and girlish-looking,\\nwith the wide innocent blue eyes of a child.\\n\\npoirot drew forward a chair for her, and she commenced talking at\\nonce.\\n\\n“you will probably think me very foolish, monsieur poirot, but lord\\ncronshaw was telling me last night how wonderfully you cleared up\\nthe mystery of his nephew’s death, and i felt that i just must have\\nyour advice. i dare say it’s only a silly hoax—gregory says so—but\\nit’s just worrying me to death.”\\n\\nshe paused for breath. poirot beamed encouragement.\\n\\n“proceed, madame. you comprehend, i am still in the dark.”\\n\\n“it’s these letters.” miss marvell unclasped her handbag, and drew\\nout three envelopes which she handed to poirot.\\n\\nthe latter scrutinized them closely.\\n\\n“cheap paper—the name and address carefully printed. let us see\\nthe inside.” he drew out the enclosure.\\n\\ni had joined him, and was leaning over his shoulder. the writing\\nconsisted of a single sentence, carefully printed like the envelope.\\nit ran as follows:\\n\\n“the great diamond which is the left eye of the god must return\\nwhence it came.”\\n\\nthe second letter was couched in precisely the same terms, but the\\nthird was more explicit:\\n\\n“you have been warned. you have not obeyed. now the diamond will\\nbe taken from you. at the full of the moon, the two diamonds which\\nare the left and right eye of the god shall return. so it is\\nwritten.”\\n\\n“the first letter i treated as a joke,” explained miss marvell.\\n“when i got the second, i began to wonder. the third one came\\nyesterday, and it seemed to me that, after all, the matter might\\nbe more serious than i had imagined.”\\n\\n“i see they did not come by post, these letters.”\\n\\n“no; they were left by hand—by a _chinaman._ that is what frightens\\nme.”\\n\\n“why?”\\n\\n“because it was from a chink in san francisco that gregory bought\\nthe stone three years ago.”\\n\\n“i see, madame, that you believe the diamond referred to to be——”\\n\\n“‘the western star,’” finished miss marvell. “that’s so. at the\\ntime, gregory remembers that there was some story attached to the\\nstone, but the chink wasn’t handing out any information. gregory\\nsays he seemed just scared to death, and in a mortal hurry to get\\nrid of the thing. he only asked about a tenth of its value. it was\\ngreg’s wedding present to me.”\\n\\npoirot nodded thoughtfully.\\n\\n“the story seems of an almost unbelievable romanticism. and yet—who\\nknows? i pray of you, hastings, hand me my little almanac.”\\n\\ni complied.\\n\\n“_voyons!_” said poirot, turning the leaves.\\n\\n“when is the date of the full moon? ah, friday next. that is in\\nthree days’ time. _eh bien_, madame, you seek my advice—i give it\\nto you. this _belle histoire_ may be a hoax—but it may not!\\ntherefore i counsel you to place the diamond in my keeping until\\nafter friday next. then we can take what steps we please.”\\n\\na slight cloud passed over the actress’s face, and she replied\\nconstrainedly:\\n\\n“i’m afraid that’s impossible.”\\n\\n“you have it with you—_hein_?” poirot was watching her narrowly.\\n\\nthe girl hesitated a moment, then slipped her hand into the bosom\\nof her gown, drawing out a long thin chain. she leaned forward,\\nunclosing her hand. in the palm, a stone of white fire, exquisitely\\nset in platinum, lay and winked at us solemnly.\\n\\npoirot drew in his breath with a long hiss.\\n\\n“_épatant!_” he murmured. “you permit, madame?” he took the jewel\\nin his own hand and scrutinized it keenly, then restored it to her\\nwith a little bow. “a magnificent stone—without a flaw. ah, _cent\\ntonnerres!_ and you carry it about with you, _comme ça_!”\\n\\n“no, no, i’m very careful really, monsieur poirot. as a rule it’s\\nlocked up in my jewel-case, and left in the hotel safe deposit.\\nwe’re staying at the _magnificent_, you know. i just brought it\\nalong to-day for you to see.”\\n\\n“and you will leave it with me, _n’est-ce pas_? you will be advised\\nby papa poirot?”\\n\\n“well, you see, it’s this way, monsieur poirot. on friday we’re\\ngoing down to yardly chase to spend a few days with lord and lady\\nyardly.”\\n\\nher words awoke a vague echo of remembrance in my mind. some\\ngossip—what was it now? a few years ago lord and lady yardly had\\npaid a visit to the states, rumour had it that his lordship had\\nrather gone the pace out there with the assistance of some lady\\nfriends—but surely there was something more, some gossip which\\ncoupled lady yardly’s name with that of a “movie” star in\\ncalifornia—why! it came to me in a flash—of course it was none\\nother than gregory b. rolf.\\n\\n“i’ll let you into a little secret, monsieur poirot,” miss marvell\\nwas continuing. “we’ve got a deal on with lord yardly. there’s some\\nchance of our arranging to film a play down there in his ancestral\\npile.”\\n\\n“at yardly chase?” i cried, interested. “why, it’s one of the show\\nplaces of england.”\\n\\nmiss marvell nodded.\\n\\n“i guess it’s the real old feudal stuff all right. but he wants a\\npretty stiff price, and of course i don’t know yet whether the deal\\nwill go through, but greg and i always like to combine business\\nwith pleasure.”\\n\\n“but—i demand pardon if i am dense, madame—surely it is possible\\nto visit yardly chase without taking the diamond with you?”\\n\\na shrewd, hard look came into miss marvell’s eyes which belied\\ntheir childlike appearance. she looked suddenly a good deal older.\\n\\n“i want to wear it down there.”\\n\\n“surely” i said suddenly, “there are some very famous jewels in\\nthe yardly collection, a large diamond amongst them?”\\n\\n“that’s so,” said miss marvell briefly.\\n\\ni heard poirot murmur beneath his breath: “ah, _c’est comme ça_!”\\nthen he said aloud, with his usual uncanny luck in hitting the\\nbull’s-eye (he dignifies it by the name of psychology): “then you\\nare without doubt already acquainted with lady yardly, or perhaps\\nyour husband is?”\\n\\n“gregory knew her when she was out west three years ago,” said miss\\nmarvell. she hesitated a moment, and then added abruptly: “do\\neither of you ever see _society gossip_?”\\n\\nwe both pleaded guilty rather shamefacedly.\\n\\n“i ask because in this week’s number there is an article on famous\\njewels, and it’s really very curious——” she broke off.\\n\\ni rose, went to the table at the other side of the room and returned\\nwith the paper in question in my hand. she took it from me, found\\nthe article, and began to read aloud:\\n\\n“. . . amongst other famous stones may be included the star of the\\neast, a diamond in the possession of the yardly family. an ancestor\\nof the present lord yardly brought it back with him from china,\\nand a romantic story is said to attach to it. according to this,\\nthe stone was once the right eye of a temple god. another diamond,\\nexactly similar in form and size, formed the left eye, and the\\nstory goes that this jewel, too, would in course of time be stolen.\\n‘one eye shall go west, the other east, till they shall meet once\\nmore. then, in triumph shall they return to the god.’ it is a\\ncurious coincidence that there is at the present time a stone\\ncorresponding closely in description with this one, and known as\\n‘the star of the west,’ or ‘the western star.’ it is the property\\nof the celebrated film actress, miss mary marvell. a comparison of\\nthe two stones would be interesting.”\\n\\nshe stopped.\\n\\n“_épatant!_” murmured poirot. “without doubt a romance of the first\\nwater.” he turned to mary marvell. “and you are not afraid, madame?\\nyou have no superstitious terrors? you do not fear to introduce\\nthese two siamese twins to each other lest a chinaman should appear\\nand, hey presto! whisk them both back to china?”\\n\\nhis tone was mocking, but i fancied that an undercurrent of\\nseriousness lay beneath it.\\n\\n“i don’t believe that lady yardly’s diamond is anything like as\\ngood a stone as mine,” said miss marvell. “anyway, i’m going to\\nsee.”\\n\\nwhat more poirot would have said i do not know, for at that moment\\nthe door flew open, and a splendid-looking man strode into the\\nroom. from his crisply curling black head, to the tips of his\\npatent-leather boots, he was a hero fit for romance.\\n\\n“i said i’d call round for you, mary,” said gregory rolf, “and here\\ni am. well, what does monsieur poirot say to our little problem?\\njust one big hoax, same as i do?”\\n\\npoirot smiled up at the big actor. they made a ridiculous contrast.\\n\\n“hoax or no hoax, mr. rolf,” he said dryly, “i have advised madame\\nyour wife not to take the jewel with her to yardly chase on friday.”\\n\\n“i’m with you there, sir. i’ve already said so to mary. but there!\\nshe’s a woman through and through, and i guess she can’t bear to\\nthink of another woman outshining her in the jewel line.”\\n\\n“what nonsense, gregory!” said mary marvell sharply. but she\\nflushed angrily.\\n\\npoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“madame, i have advised. i can do no more. _c’est fini_.”\\n\\nhe bowed them both to the door.\\n\\n“ah! _la la_,” he observed, returning. “_histoire de femmes!_ the\\ngood husband, he hit the nail on the head—_tout de même_, he was\\nnot tactful! assuredly not.”\\n\\ni imparted to him my vague remembrances, and he nodded vigorously.\\n\\n“so i thought. all the same, there is something curious underneath\\nall this. with your permission, _mon ami_, i will take the air.\\nawait my return, i beg of you. i shall not be long.”\\n\\ni was half asleep in my chair when the landlady tapped on the door,\\nand put her head in.\\n\\n“it’s another lady to see mr. poirot, sir. i’ve told her he was\\nout, but she says as how she’ll wait, seeing as she’s come up from\\nthe country.”\\n\\n“oh, show her in here, mrs. murchison. perhaps i can do something\\nfor her.”\\n\\nin another moment the lady had been ushered in. my heart gave a\\nleap as i recognized her. lady yardly’s portrait had figured too\\noften in the society papers to allow her to remain unknown.\\n\\n“do sit down, lady yardly,” i said, drawing forward a chair. “my\\nfriend poirot is out, but i know for a fact that he’ll be back very\\nshortly.”\\n\\nshe thanked me and sat down. a very different type, this, from miss\\nmary marvell. tall, dark, with flashing eyes, and a pale proud\\nface—yet something wistful in the curves of the mouth.\\n\\ni felt a desire to rise to the occasion. why not? in poirot’s\\npresence i have frequently felt a difficulty—i do not appear at my\\nbest. and yet there is no doubt that i, too, possess the deductive\\nsense in a marked degree. i leant forward on a sudden impulse.\\n\\n“lady yardly,” i said, “i know why you have come here. you have\\nreceived blackmailing letters about the diamond.”\\n\\nthere was no doubt as to my bolt having shot home. she stared at\\nme open-mouthed, all colour banished from her cheeks.\\n\\n“you know?” she gasped. “how?”\\n\\ni smiled.\\n\\n“by a perfectly logical process. if miss marvell has had warning\\nletters——”\\n\\n“miss marvell? she has been here?”\\n\\n“she has just left. as i was saying, if she, as the holder of one\\nof the twin diamonds, has received a mysterious series of warnings,\\nyou, as the holder of the other stone, must necessarily have done\\nthe same. you see how simple it is? i am right, then, you have\\nreceived these strange communications also?”\\n\\nfor a moment she hesitated, as though in doubt whether to trust me\\nor not, then she bowed her head in assent with a little smile.\\n\\n“that is so,” she acknowledged.\\n\\n“were yours, too, left by hand—by a chinaman?”\\n\\n“no, they came by post; but, tell me, has miss marvell undergone\\nthe same experience, then?”\\n\\ni recounted to her the events of the morning. she listened\\nattentively.\\n\\n“it all fits in. my letters are the duplicates of hers. it is true\\nthat they came by post, but there is a curious perfume impregnating\\nthem—something in the nature of joss-stick—that at once suggested\\nthe east to me. what does it all mean?”\\n\\ni shook my head.\\n\\n“that is what we must find out. you have the letters with you? we\\nmight learn something from the postmarks.”\\n\\n“unfortunately i destroyed them. you understand, at the time i\\nregarded it as some foolish joke. can it be true that some chinese\\ngang are really trying to recover the diamonds? it seems too\\nincredible.”\\n\\nwe went over the facts again and again, but could get no further\\ntowards the elucidation of the mystery. at last lady yardly rose.\\n\\n“i really don’t think i need wait for monsieur poirot. you can tell\\nhim all this, can’t you? thank you so much, mr.——”\\n\\nshe hesitated, her hand outstretched.\\n\\n“captain hastings.”\\n\\n“of course! how stupid of me. you’re a friend of the cavendishes,\\naren’t you? it was mary cavendish who sent me to monsieur poirot.”\\n\\nwhen my friend returned, i enjoyed telling him the tale of what\\nhad occurred during his absence. he cross-questioned me rather\\nsharply over the details of our conversation and i could read\\nbetween the lines that he was not best pleased to have been absent.\\ni also fancied that the dear old fellow was just the least inclined\\nto be jealous. it had become rather a pose with him to consistently\\nbelittle my abilities, and i think he was chagrined at finding no\\nloophole for criticism. i was secretly rather pleased with myself,\\nthough i tried to conceal the fact for fear of irritating him. in\\nspite of his idiosyncrasies, i was deeply attached to my quaint\\nlittle friend.\\n\\n“_bien!_” he said at length, with a curious look on his face. “the\\nplot develops. pass me, i pray you, that ‘peerage’ on the top shelf\\nthere.” he turned the leaves. “ah, here we are! ‘yardly . . . 10th\\nviscount, served south african war’ . . . _tout ça n’a pas\\nd’importance_ . . . ‘mar. 1907 hon. maude stopperton, fourth\\ndaughter of 3rd baron cotteril’ . . . um, um, um, . . . ‘has iss.\\ntwo daughters, born 1908, 1910. . . . clubs . . . residences.’ . . .\\n_voilà_, that does not tell us much. but to-morrow morning we see\\nthis _milord_!”\\n\\n“what?”\\n\\n“yes. i telegraphed to him.”\\n\\n“i thought you had washed your hands of the case?”\\n\\n“i am not acting for miss marvell since she refuses to be guided\\nby my advice. what i do now is for my own satisfaction—the\\nsatisfaction of hercule poirot! decidedly, i must have a finger in\\nthis pie.”\\n\\n“and you calmly wire lord yardly to dash up to town just to suit\\nyour convenience. he won’t be pleased.”\\n\\n“_au contraire_, if i preserve for him his family diamond, he ought\\nto be very grateful.”\\n\\n“then you really think there is a chance of it being stolen?” i\\nasked eagerly.\\n\\n“almost a certainty,” replied poirot placidly. “everything points\\nthat way.”\\n\\n“but how——”\\n\\npoirot stopped my eager questions with an airy gesture of the hand.\\n\\n“not now, i pray you. let us not confuse the mind. and observe that\\n‘peerage’—how you have replaced him! see you not that the tallest\\nbooks go in the top shelf, the next tallest in the row beneath,\\nand so on. thus we have order, _method_, which, as i have often\\ntold you, hastings——”\\n\\n“exactly,” i said hastily, and put the offending volume in its\\nproper place.\\n\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\n\\nlord yardly turned out to be a cheery, loud-voiced sportsman with\\na rather red face, but with a good-humoured bonhomie about him that\\nwas distinctly attractive and made up for any lack of mentality.\\n\\n“extraordinary business this, monsieur poirot. can’t make head or\\ntail of it. seems my wife’s been getting odd kind of letters, and\\nthat this miss marvell’s had ’em too. what does it all mean?”\\n\\npoirot handed him the copy of _society gossip_.\\n\\n“first, _milord_, i would ask you if these facts are substantially\\ncorrect?”\\n\\nthe peer took it. his face darkened with anger as he read.\\n\\n“damned nonsense!” he spluttered. “there’s never been any romantic\\nstory attaching to the diamond. it came from india originally, i\\nbelieve. i never heard of all this chinese god stuff.”\\n\\n“still, the stone _is_ known as ‘the star of the east.’”\\n\\n“well, what if it is?” he demanded wrathfully.\\n\\npoirot smiled a little, but made no direct reply. “what i would\\nask you to do, _milord_, is to place yourself in my hands. if you\\ndo so unreservedly, i have great hopes of averting the catastrophe.”\\n\\n“then you think there’s actually something in these wild-cat\\ntales?”\\n\\n“will you do as i ask you?”\\n\\n“of course i will, but——”\\n\\n“_bien!_ then permit that i ask you a few questions. this affair\\nof yardly chase, is it, as you say, all fixed up between you and\\nmr. rolf?”\\n\\n“oh, he told you about it, did he? no, there’s nothing settled.”\\nhe hesitated, the brick-red colour of his face deepening. “might\\nas well get the thing straight. i’ve made rather an ass of myself\\nin many ways, monsieur poirot—and i’m head over ears in debt—but\\ni want to pull up. i’m fond of the kids, and i want to straighten\\nthings up, and be able to live on at the old place. gregory rolf\\nis offering me big money—enough to set me on my feet again. i don’t\\nwant to do it—i hate the thought of all that crowd play-acting\\nround the chase—but i may have to, unless——” he broke off.\\n\\npoirot eyed him keenly. “you have, then, another string to your\\nbow? permit that i make a guess? it is to sell the star of the\\neast?”\\n\\nlord yardly nodded. “that’s it. it’s been in the family for some\\ngenerations, but it’s not entailed. still, it’s not the easiest\\nthing in the world to find a purchaser. hoffberg, the hatton garden\\nman, is on the look-out for a likely customer, but he’ll have to\\nfind one soon, or it’s a washout.”\\n\\n“one more question, _permettez_—lady yardly, which plan does she\\napprove?”\\n\\n“oh, she’s bitterly opposed to my selling the jewel. you know what\\nwomen are. she’s all for this film stunt.”\\n\\n“i comprehend,” said poirot. he remained a moment or so in thought,\\nthen rose briskly to his feet. “you return to yardly chase at once?\\n_bien!_ say no word to anyone—to _anyone_ mind—but expect us there\\nthis evening. we will arrive shortly after five.”\\n\\n“all right, but i don’t see——”\\n\\n“_ça n’a pas d’importance_,” said poirot kindly. “you will that i\\npreserve for you your diamond, _n’est-ce pas_?”\\n\\n“yes, but——”\\n\\n“then do as i say.”\\n\\na sadly bewildered nobleman left the room.\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\nit was half-past five when we arrived at yardly chase, and followed\\nthe dignified butler to the old panelled hall with its fire of\\nblazing logs. a pretty picture met our eyes: lady yardly and her\\ntwo children, the mother’s proud dark head bent down over the two\\nfair ones. lord yardly stood near, smiling down on them.\\n\\n“monsieur poirot and captain hastings,” announced the butler.\\n\\nlady yardly looked up with a start, her husband came forward\\nuncertainly, his eyes seeking instruction from poirot. the little\\nman was equal to the occasion.\\n\\n“all my excuses! it is that i investigate still this affair of miss\\nmarvell’s. she comes to you on friday, does she not? i make a\\nlittle tour first to make sure that all is secure. also i wanted\\nto ask of lady yardly if she recollected at all the postmarks on\\nthe letters she received?”\\n\\nlady yardly shook her head regretfully. “i’m afraid i don’t. it is\\nstupid of me. but, you see, i never dreamt of taking them\\nseriously.”\\n\\n“you’ll stay the night?” said lord yardly.\\n\\n“oh, _milord_, i fear to incommode you. we have left our bags at\\nthe inn.”\\n\\n“that’s all right.” lord yardly had his cue. “we’ll send down for\\nthem. no, no—no trouble, i assure you.”\\n\\npoirot permitted himself to be persuaded, and sitting down by lady\\nyardly, began to make friends with the children. in a short time\\nthey were all romping together, and had dragged me into the game.\\n\\n“_vous êtes bonne mère_,” said poirot, with a gallant little bow,\\nas the children were removed reluctantly by a stern nurse.\\n\\nlady yardly smoothed her ruffled hair.\\n\\n“i adore them,” she said with a little catch in her voice.\\n\\n“and they you—with reason!” poirot bowed again.\\n\\na dressing-gong sounded, and we rose to go up to our rooms. at that\\nmoment the butler entered with a telegram on a salver which he\\nhanded to lord yardly. the latter tore it open with a brief word\\nof apology. as he read it he stiffened visibly.\\n\\nwith an ejaculation, he handed it to his wife. then he glanced at\\nmy friend.\\n\\n“just a minute, monsieur poirot. i feel you ought to know about\\nthis. it’s from hoffberg. he thinks he’s found a customer for the\\ndiamond—an american, sailing for the states to-morrow. they’re\\nsending down a chap to-night to vet the stone. by jove, though, if\\nthis goes through——” words failed him.\\n\\nlady yardly had turned away. she still held the telegram in her\\nhand.\\n\\n“i wish you wouldn’t sell it, george,” she said, in a low voice.\\n“it’s been in the family so long.” she waited, as though for a\\nreply, but when none came her face hardened. she shrugged her\\nshoulders. “i must go and dress. i suppose i had better display\\n‘the goods.’” she turned to poirot with a slight grimace. “it’s\\none of the most hideous necklaces that was ever designed! george\\nhas always promised to have the stones reset for me, but it’s never\\nbeen done.” she left the room.\\n\\nhalf an hour later, we three were assembled in the great drawing-room\\nawaiting the lady. it was already a few minutes past the dinner\\nhour.\\n\\nsuddenly there was a low rustle, and lady yardly appeared framed\\nin the doorway, a radiant figure in a long white shimmering dress.\\nround the column of her neck was a rivulet of fire. she stood there\\nwith one hand just touching the necklace.\\n\\n“behold the sacrifice,” she said gaily. her ill-humour seemed to\\nhave vanished. “wait while i turn the big light on and you shall\\nfeast your eyes on the ugliest necklace in england.”\\n\\nthe switches were just outside the door. as she stretched out her\\nhand to them, the incredible thing happened. suddenly without any\\nwarning, every light was extinguished, the door banged, and from\\nthe other side of it came a long-drawn piercing woman’s scream.\\n\\n“my god!” cried lord yardly. “that was maude’s voice! what has\\nhappened?”\\n\\nwe rushed blindly for the door, cannoning into each other in the\\ndarkness. it was some minutes before we could find it. what a sight\\nmet our eyes! lady yardly lay senseless on the marble floor, a\\ncrimson mark on her white throat where the necklace had been\\nwrenched from her neck.\\n\\nas we bent over her, uncertain for the moment whether she were dead\\nor alive, her eyelids opened.\\n\\n“the chinaman,” she whispered painfully. “the chinaman—the side\\ndoor.”\\n\\nlord yardly sprang up with an oath. i accompanied him, my heart\\nbeating wildly. the chinaman again! the side door in question was\\na small one in the angle of the wall, not more than a dozen yards\\nfrom the scene of the tragedy. as we reached it, i gave a cry.\\nthere, just short of the threshold, lay the glittering necklace,\\nevidently dropped by the thief in the panic of his flight. i\\nswooped joyously down on it. then i uttered another cry which lord\\nyardly echoed. for in the middle of the necklace was a great gap.\\nthe star of the east was missing!\\n\\n“that settles it,” i breathed. “these were no ordinary thieves.\\nthis one stone was all they wanted.”\\n\\n“but how did the fellow get in?”\\n\\n“through this door.”\\n\\n“but it’s always locked.”\\n\\ni shook my head. “it’s not locked now. see.” i pulled it open as\\ni spoke.\\n\\nas i did so something fluttered to the ground. i picked it up. it\\nwas a piece of silk, and the embroidery was unmistakable. it had\\nbeen torn from a chinaman’s robe.\\n\\n“in his haste it caught in the door,” i explained. “come, hurry.\\nhe cannot have gone far as yet.”\\n\\nbut in vain we hunted and searched. in the pitch darkness of the\\nnight, the thief had found it easy to make his getaway. we returned\\nreluctantly, and lord yardly sent off one of the footmen post-haste\\nto fetch the police.\\n\\nlady yardly, aptly ministered to by poirot, who is as good as a\\nwoman in these matters, was sufficiently recovered to be able to\\ntell her story.\\n\\n“i was just going to turn on the other light,” she said, “when a\\nman sprang on me from behind. he tore my necklace from my neck with\\nsuch force that i fell headlong to the floor. as i fell i saw him\\ndisappearing through the side door. then i realized by the pig-tail\\nand the embroidered robe that he was a chinaman.” she stopped with\\na shudder.\\n\\nthe butler reappeared. he spoke in a low voice to lord yardly.\\n\\n“a gentleman from mr. hoffberg’s, m’lord. he says you expect him.”\\n\\n“good heavens!” cried the distracted nobleman. “i must see him, i\\nsuppose. no, not here, mullings, in the library.”\\n\\ni drew poirot aside.\\n\\n“look here, my dear fellow, hadn’t we better get back to london?”\\n\\n“you think so, hastings? why?”\\n\\n“well”—i coughed delicately—“things haven’t gone very well, have\\nthey? i mean, you tell lord yardly to place himself in your hands\\nand all will be well—and then the diamond vanishes from under your\\nvery nose!”\\n\\n“true,” said poirot, rather crestfallen. “it was not one of my most\\nstriking triumphs.”\\n\\nthis way of describing events almost caused me to smile, but i\\nstuck to my guns.\\n\\n“so, having—pardon the expression—rather made a mess of things,\\ndon’t you think it would be more graceful to leave immediately?”\\n\\n“and the dinner, the without doubt excellent dinner, that the\\n_chef_ of lord yardly has prepared?”\\n\\n“oh, what’s dinner!” i said impatiently.\\n\\npoirot held up his hands in horror.\\n\\n“_mon dieu!_ it is that in this country you treat the affairs\\ngastronomic with a criminal indifference.”\\n\\n“there’s another reason why we should get back to london as soon\\nas possible,” i continued.\\n\\n“what is that, my friend?”\\n\\n“the other diamond,” i said, lowering my voice. “miss marvell’s.”\\n\\n“_eh bien_, what of it?”\\n\\n“don’t you see?” his unusual obtuseness annoyed me. what had\\nhappened to his usually keen wits? “they’ve got one, now they’ll\\ngo for the other.”\\n\\n“_tiens!_” cried poirot, stepping back a pace and regarding me with\\nadmiration. “but your brain marches to a marvel, my friend! figure\\nto yourself that for the moment i had not thought of that! but\\nthere is plenty of time. the full of the moon, it is not until\\nfriday.”\\n\\ni shook my head dubiously. the full of the moon theory left me\\nentirely cold. i had my way with poirot, however, and we departed\\nimmediately, leaving behind us a note of explanation and apology\\nfor lord yardly.\\n\\nmy idea was to go at once to the _magnificent_, and relate to miss\\nmarvell what had occurred, but poirot vetoed the plan, and insisted\\nthat the morning would be time enough. i gave in rather grudgingly.\\n\\nin the morning poirot seemed strangely disinclined to stir out. i\\nbegan to suspect that, having made a mistake to start with, he was\\nsingularly loath to proceed with the case. in answer to my\\npersuasions, he pointed out, with admirable common sense, that as\\nthe details of the affair at yardly chase were already in the\\nmorning papers the rolfs would know quite as much as we could tell\\nthem. i gave way unwillingly.\\n\\nevents proved my forebodings to be justified. about two o’clock,\\nthe telephone rang. poirot answered it. he listened for some\\nmoments, then with a brief “_bien, j’y serai_” he rang off, and\\nturned to me.\\n\\n“what do you think, _mon ami_?” he looked half ashamed, half\\nexcited. “the diamond of miss marvell, it has been stolen.”\\n\\n“what?” i cried, springing up. “and what about the ‘full of the\\nmoon’ now?” poirot hung his head. “when did this happen?”\\n\\n“this morning, i understand.”\\n\\ni shook my head sadly. “if only you had listened to me. you see i\\nwas right.”\\n\\n“it appears so, _mon ami_,” said poirot cautiously. “appearances\\nare deceptive, they say, but it certainly appears so.”\\n\\nas we hurried in a taxi to the _magnificent_, i puzzled out the\\ntrue inwardness of the scheme.\\n\\n“that ‘full of the moon’ idea was clever. the whole point of it\\nwas to get us to concentrate on the friday, and so be off our guard\\nbeforehand. it is a pity you did not realize that.”\\n\\n“_ma foi!_” said poirot airily, his nonchalance quite restored\\nafter its brief eclipse. “one cannot think of everything!”\\n\\ni felt sorry for him. he did so hate failure of any kind.\\n\\n“cheer up,” i said consolingly. “better luck next time.”\\n\\nat the _magnificent_, we were ushered at once into the manager’s\\noffice. gregory rolf was there with two men from scotland yard. a\\npale-faced clerk sat opposite them.\\n\\nrolf nodded to us as we entered.\\n\\n“we’re getting to the bottom of it,” he said. “but it’s almost\\nunbelievable. how the guy had the nerve i can’t think.”\\n\\na very few minutes sufficed to give us the facts. mr. rolf had gone\\nout of the hotel at 11.15. at 11.30, a gentleman, so like him in\\nappearance as to pass muster, entered the hotel and demanded the\\njewel-case from the safe deposit. he duly signed the receipt,\\nremarking carelessly as he did so: “looks a bit different from my\\nordinary one, but i hurt my hand getting out of the taxi.” the\\nclerk merely smiled and remarked that he saw very little difference.\\nrolf laughed and said: “well, don’t run me in as a crook this time,\\nanyway. i’ve been getting threatening letters from a chinaman, and\\nthe worst of it is i look rather like a chink myself—it’s something\\nabout the eyes.”\\n\\n“i looked at him,” said the clerk who was telling us this, “and i\\nsaw at once what he meant. the eyes slanted up at the corners like\\nan oriental’s. i’d never noticed it before.”\\n\\n“darn it all, man,” roared gregory rolf, leaning forward, “do you\\nnotice it now?”\\n\\nthe man looked up at him and started.\\n\\n“no, sir,” he said. “i can’t say i do.” and indeed there was\\nnothing even remotely oriental about the frank brown eyes that\\nlooked into ours.\\n\\nthe scotland yard man grunted. “bold customer. thought the eyes\\nmight be noticed, and took the bull by the horns to disarm\\nsuspicion. he must have watched you out of the hotel, sir, and\\nnipped in as soon as you were well away.”\\n\\n“what about the jewel-case?” i asked.\\n\\n“it was found in a corridor of the hotel. only one thing had been\\ntaken—‘the western star.’”\\n\\nwe stared at each other—the whole thing was so bizarre, so unreal.\\n\\npoirot hopped briskly to his feet. “i have not been of much use,\\ni fear,” he said regretfully. “is it permitted to see madame?”\\n\\n“i guess she’s prostrated with the shock,” explained rolf.\\n\\n“then perhaps i might have a few words alone with you, monsieur?”\\n\\n“certainly.”\\n\\nin about five minutes poirot reappeared.\\n\\n“now, my friend,” he said gaily. “to a post office. i have to send\\na telegram.”\\n\\n“who to?”\\n\\n“lord yardly.” he discounted further inquiries by slipping his arm\\nthrough mine. “come, come, _mon ami_. i know all that you feel\\nabout this miserable business. i have not distinguished myself!\\nyou, in my place, might have distinguished yourself! _bien!_ all\\nis admitted. let us forget it and have lunch.”\\n\\nit was about four o’clock when we entered poirot’s rooms. a figure\\nrose from a chair by the window. it was lord yardly. he looked\\nhaggard and distraught.\\n\\n“i got your wire and came up at once. look here, i’ve been round\\nto hoffberg, and they know nothing about that man of theirs last\\nnight, or the wire either. do you think that——”\\n\\npoirot held up his hand.\\n\\n“my excuses! i sent that wire, and hired the gentleman in question.”\\n\\n“_you_—but why? what?” the nobleman spluttered impotently.\\n\\n“my little idea was to bring things to a head,” explained poirot\\nplacidly.\\n\\n“bring things to a head! oh, my god!” cried lord yardly.\\n\\n“and the ruse succeeded,” said poirot cheerfully. “therefore,\\n_milord_, i have much pleasure in returning you—this!” with a\\ndramatic gesture he produced a glittering object. it was a great\\ndiamond.\\n\\n“the star of the east,” gasped lord yardly. “but i don’t\\nunderstand——”\\n\\n“no?” said poirot. “it makes no matter. believe me, it was necessary\\nfor the diamond to be stolen. i promised you that it should be\\npreserved to you, and i have kept my word. you must permit me to\\nkeep my little secret. convey, i beg of you, the assurances of my\\ndeepest respect to lady yardly, and tell her how pleased i am to\\nbe able to restore her jewel to her. what _beau temps_, is it not?\\ngood day, _milord_.”\\n\\nand smiling and talking, the amazing little man conducted the\\nbewildered nobleman to the door. he returned gently rubbing his\\nhands.\\n\\n“poirot,” i said. “am i quite demented?”\\n\\n“no, _mon ami_, but you are, as always, in a mental fog.”\\n\\n“how did you get the diamond.”\\n\\n“from mr. rolf.”\\n\\n“rolf?”\\n\\n“_mais oui!_ the warning letters, the chinaman, the article in\\n_society gossip_, all sprang from the ingenious brain of mr. rolf!\\nthe two diamonds, supposed to be so miraculously alike—bah! they\\ndid not exist. there was only _one_ diamond, my friend! originally\\nin the yardly collection, for three years it has been in the\\npossession of mr. rolf. he stole it this morning with the assistance\\nof a touch of grease paint at the corner of each eye! ah, i must\\nsee him on the film, he is indeed an artist, _celui-là_!\\n\\n“but why should he steal his own diamond?” i asked, puzzled.\\n\\n“for many reasons. to begin with, lady yardly was getting restive.”\\n\\n“lady yardly?”\\n\\n“you comprehend she was left much alone in california. her husband\\nwas amusing himself elsewhere. mr. rolf was handsome, he had an\\nair about him of romance. but _au fond_, he is very business-like,\\n_ce monsieur_! he made love to lady yardly, and then he blackmailed\\nher. i taxed the lady with the truth the other night, and she\\nadmitted it. she swore that she had only been indiscreet, and i\\nbelieve her. but, undoubtedly, rolf had letters of hers that could\\nbe twisted to bear a different interpretation. terrified by the\\nthreat of a divorce, and the prospect of being separated from her\\nchildren, she agreed to all he wished. she had no money of her own,\\nand she was forced to permit him to substitute a paste replica for\\nthe real stone. the coincidence of the date of the appearance of\\n‘the western star’ struck me at once. all goes well. lord yardly\\nprepares to range himself—to settle down. and then comes the menace\\nof the possible sale of the diamond. the substitution will be\\ndiscovered. without doubt she writes off frantically to gregory\\nrolf who has just arrived in england. he soothes her by promising\\nto arrange all—and prepares for a double robbery. in this way he\\nwill quiet the lady, who might conceivably tell all to her husband,\\nan affair which would not suit our blackmailer at all, he will have\\n£50,000 insurance money (aha, you had forgotten that!), and he will\\nstill have the diamond! at this point i put my finger in the pie.\\nthe arrival of a diamond expert is announced. lady yardly, as i\\nfelt sure she would, immediately arranges a robbery—and does it\\nvery well too! but hercule poirot, he sees nothing but facts. what\\nhappens in actuality? the lady switches off the light, bangs the\\ndoor, throws the necklace down the passage, and screams. she has\\nalready wrenched out the diamond with pliers upstairs——”\\n\\n“but we saw the necklace round her neck!” i objected.\\n\\n“i demand pardon, my friend. her hand concealed the part of it\\nwhere the gap would have shown. to place a piece of silk in the\\ndoor beforehand is child’s play! of course, as soon as rolf read\\nof the robbery, he arranged his own little comedy. and very well\\nhe played it!”\\n\\n“what did you say to him?” i asked with lively curiosity.\\n\\n“i said to him that lady yardly had told her husband all, that i\\nwas empowered to recover the jewel, and that if it were not\\nimmediately handed over proceedings would be taken. also a few more\\nlittle lies which occurred to me. he was as wax in my hands!”\\n\\ni pondered the matter.\\n\\n“it seems a little unfair on mary marvell. she has lost her diamond\\nthrough no fault of her own.”\\n\\n“bah!” said poirot brutally. “she has a magnificent advertisement.\\nthat is all she cares for, that one! now the other, she is\\ndifferent. _bonne mère, très femme!_”\\n\\n“yes,” i said doubtfully, hardly sharing poirot’s views on\\nfemininity. “i suppose it was rolf who sent her the duplicate\\nletters.”\\n\\n“_pas du tout_,” said poirot briskly. “she came by the advice of\\nmary cavendish to seek my aid in her dilemma. then she heard that\\nmary marvell, whom she knew to be her enemy, had been here, and\\nshe changed her mind, jumping at a pretext that _you_, my friend,\\noffered her. a very few questions sufficed to show me that _you_\\ntold her of the letters, not she you! she jumped at the chance your\\nwords offered.”\\n\\n“i don’t believe it,” i cried, stung.\\n\\n“_si, si, mon ami_, it is a pity that you study not the psychology.\\nshe told you that the letters were destroyed? oh, la la, _never_\\ndoes a woman destroy a letter if she can avoid it! not even if it\\nwould be more prudent to do so!”\\n\\n“it’s all very well,” i said, my anger rising, “but you’ve made a\\nperfect fool of me! from beginning to end! no, it’s all very well\\nto try and explain it away afterwards. there really is a limit!”\\n\\n“but you were so enjoying yourself, my friend. i had not the heart\\nto shatter your illusions.”\\n\\n“it’s no good. you’ve gone a bit too far this time.”\\n\\n“_mon dieu!_ but how you enrage yourself for nothing, _mon ami_!”\\n\\n“i’m fed up!” i went out, banging the door. poirot had made an\\nabsolute laughing-stock of me. i decided that he needed a sharp\\nlesson. i would let some time elapse before i forgave him. he had\\nencouraged me to make a perfect fool of myself!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  ii\\n\\n\\n  the tragedy at marsdon manor\\n\\n\\ni had been called away from town for a few days, and on my return\\nfound poirot in the act of strapping up his small valise.\\n\\n“_a la bonne heure_, hastings. i feared you would not have returned\\nin time to accompany me.”\\n\\n“you are called away on a case, then?”\\n\\n“yes, though i am bound to admit that, on the face of it, the\\naffair does not seem promising. the northern union insurance\\ncompany have asked me to investigate the death of a mr. maltravers\\nwho a few weeks ago insured his life with them for the large sum\\nof fifty thousand pounds.”\\n\\n“yes?” i said, much interested.\\n\\n“there was, of course, the usual suicide clause in the policy. in\\nthe event of his committing suicide within a year the premiums\\nwould be forfeited. mr. maltravers was duly examined by the\\ncompany’s own doctor, and although he was a man slightly past the\\nprime of life was passed as being in quite sound health. however,\\non wednesday last—the day before yesterday—the body of mr.\\nmaltravers was found in the grounds of his house in essex, marsdon\\nmanor, and the cause of his death is described as some kind of\\ninternal hæmorrhage. that in itself would be nothing remarkable,\\nbut sinister rumours as to mr. maltravers’ financial position have\\nbeen in the air of late, and the northern union have ascertained\\nbeyond any possible doubt that the deceased gentleman stood upon\\nthe verge of bankruptcy. now that alters matters considerably.\\nmaltravers had a beautiful young wife, and it is suggested that he\\ngot together all the ready money he could for the purpose of paying\\nthe premiums on a life insurance for his wife’s benefit, and then\\ncommitted suicide. such a thing is not uncommon. in any case, my\\nfriend alfred wright, who is a director of the northern union, has\\nasked me to investigate the facts of the case, but, as i told him,\\ni am not very hopeful of success. if the cause of the death had\\nbeen heart failure, i should have been more sanguine. heart failure\\nmay always be translated as the inability of the local g.p. to\\ndiscover what his patient really did die of, but a hæmorrhage seems\\nfairly definite. still, we can but make some necessary inquiries.\\nfive minutes to pack your bag, hastings, and we will take a taxi\\nto liverpool street.”\\n\\nabout an hour later, we alighted from a great eastern train at the\\nlittle station of marsdon leigh. inquiries at the station yielded\\nthe information that marsdon manor was about a mile distant. poirot\\ndecided to walk, and we betook ourselves along the main street.\\n\\n“what is our plan of campaign?” i asked.\\n\\n“first i will call upon the doctor. i have ascertained that there\\nis only one doctor in marsdon leigh, dr. ralph bernard. ah, here\\nwe are at his house.”\\n\\nthe house in question was a kind of superior cottage, standing back\\na little from the road. a brass plate on the gate bore the doctor’s\\nname. we passed up the path and rang the bell.\\n\\nwe proved to be fortunate in our call. it was the doctor’s\\nconsulting hour, and for the moment there were no patients waiting\\nfor him. dr. bernard was an elderly man, high-shouldered and\\nstooping, with a pleasant vagueness of manner.\\n\\npoirot introduced himself and explained the purpose of our visit,\\nadding that insurance companies were bound to investigate fully in\\na case of this kind.\\n\\n“of course, of course,” said dr. bernard vaguely. “i suppose, as\\nhe was such a rich man, his life was insured for a big sum?”\\n\\n“you consider him a rich man, doctor?”\\n\\nthe doctor looked rather surprised.\\n\\n“was he not? he kept two cars, you know, and marsdon manor is a\\npretty big place to keep up, although i believe he bought it very\\ncheap.”\\n\\n“i understand that he had had considerable losses of late,” said\\npoirot, watching the doctor narrowly.\\n\\nthe latter, however, merely shook his head sadly.\\n\\n“is that so? indeed. it is fortunate for his wife, then, that there\\nis this life insurance. a very beautiful and charming young\\ncreature, but terribly unstrung by this sad catastrophe. a mass of\\nnerves, poor thing. i have tried to spare her all i can, but of\\ncourse the shock was bound to be considerable.”\\n\\n“you had been attending mr. maltravers recently?”\\n\\n“my dear sir, i never attended him.”\\n\\n“what?”\\n\\n“i understand mr. maltravers was a christian scientist—or something\\nof that kind.”\\n\\n“but you examined the body?”\\n\\n“certainly. i was fetched by one of the under-gardeners.”\\n\\n“and the cause of death was clear?”\\n\\n“absolutely. there was blood on the lips, but most of the bleeding\\nmust have been internal.”\\n\\n“was he still lying where he had been found?”\\n\\n“yes, the body had not been touched. he was lying at the edge of\\na small plantation. he had evidently been out shooting rooks, a\\nsmall rook rifle lay beside him. the hæmorrhage must have occurred\\nquite suddenly. gastric ulcer, without a doubt.”\\n\\n“no question of his having been shot, eh?”\\n\\n“my dear sir!”\\n\\n“i demand pardon,” said poirot humbly. “but, if my memory is not\\nat fault, in the case of a recent murder, the doctor first gave a\\nverdict of heart failure—altering it when the local constable\\npointed out that there was a bullet wound through the head!”\\n\\n“you will not find any bullet wounds on the body of mr. maltravers,”\\nsaid dr. bernard dryly. “now, gentlemen, if there is nothing\\nfurther——”\\n\\nwe took the hint.\\n\\n“good morning, and many thanks to you, doctor, for so kindly\\nanswering our questions. by the way, you saw no need for an\\nautopsy?”\\n\\n“certainly not.” the doctor became quite apoplectic. “the cause of\\ndeath was clear, and in my profession we see no need to distress\\nunduly the relatives of a dead patient.”\\n\\nand, turning, the doctor slammed the door sharply in our faces.\\n\\n“and what do you think of dr. bernard, hastings?” inquired poirot,\\nas we proceeded on our way to the manor.\\n\\n“rather an old ass.”\\n\\n“exactly. your judgments of character are always profound, my\\nfriend.”\\n\\ni glanced at him uneasily, but he seemed perfectly serious. a\\ntwinkle, however, came into his eye, and he added slyly:\\n\\n“that is to say, when there is no question of a beautiful woman!”\\n\\ni looked at him coldly.\\n\\non our arrival at the manor-house, the door was opened to us by a\\nmiddle-aged parlourmaid. poirot handed her his card, and a letter\\nfrom the insurance company for mrs. maltravers. she showed us into\\na small morning-room, and retired to tell her mistress. about ten\\nminutes elapsed, and then the door opened, and a slender figure in\\nwidow’s weeds stood upon the threshold.\\n\\n“monsieur poirot?” she faltered.\\n\\n“madame!” poirot sprang gallantly to his feet and hastened towards\\nher. “i cannot tell you how i regret to derange you in this way.\\nbut what will you? _les affaires_—they know no mercy.”\\n\\nmrs. maltravers permitted him to lead her to a chair. her eyes were\\nred with weeping, but the temporary disfigurement could not conceal\\nher extraordinary beauty. she was about twenty-seven or eight, and\\nvery fair, with large blue eyes and a pretty pouting mouth.\\n\\n“it is something about my husband’s insurance, is it? but must i\\nbe bothered _now_—so soon?”\\n\\n“courage, my dear madame. courage! you see, your late husband\\ninsured his life for rather a large sum, and in such a case the\\ncompany always has to satisfy itself as to a few details. they have\\nempowered me to act for them. you can rest assured that i will do\\nall in my power to render the matter not too unpleasant for you.\\nwill you recount to me briefly the sad events of wednesday?”\\n\\n“i was changing for tea when my maid came up—one of the gardeners\\nhad just run to the house. he had found——”\\n\\nher voice trailed away. poirot pressed her hand sympathetically.\\n\\n“i comprehend. enough! you had seen your husband earlier in the\\nafternoon?”\\n\\n“not since lunch. i had walked down to the village for some stamps,\\nand i believe he was out pottering round the grounds.”\\n\\n“shooting rooks, eh?”\\n\\n“yes, he usually took his little rook rifle with him, and i heard\\none or two shots in the distance.”\\n\\n“where is this little rook rifle now?”\\n\\n“in the hall, i think.”\\n\\nshe led the way out of the room and found and handed the little\\nweapon to poirot, who examined it cursorily.\\n\\n“two shots fired, i see,” he observed, as he handed it back. “and\\nnow, madame, if i might see——”\\n\\nhe paused delicately.\\n\\n“the servant shall take you,” she murmured, averting her head.\\n\\nthe parlourmaid, summoned, led poirot upstairs. i remained with\\nthe lovely and unfortunate woman. it was hard to know whether to\\nspeak or remain silent. i essayed one or two general reflections\\nto which she responded absently, and in a very few minutes poirot\\nrejoined us.\\n\\n“i thank you for all your courtesy, madame. i do not think you need\\nbe troubled any further with this matter. by the way, do you know\\nanything of your husband’s financial position?”\\n\\nshe shook her head.\\n\\n“nothing whatever. i am very stupid over business things.”\\n\\n“i see. then you can give us no clue as to why he suddenly decided\\nto insure his life? he had not done so previously, i understand.”\\n\\n“well, we had only been married a little over a year. but, as to\\nwhy he insured his life, it was because he had absolutely made up\\nhis mind that he would not live long. he had a strong premonition\\nof his own death. i gather that he had had one hæmorrhage already,\\nand that he knew that another one would prove fatal. i tried to\\ndispel these gloomy fears of his, but without avail. alas, he was\\nonly too right!”\\n\\ntears in her eyes, she bade us a dignified farewell. poirot made\\na characteristic gesture as we walked down the drive together.\\n\\n“_eh bien_, that is that! back to london, my friend, there appears\\nto be no mouse in this mouse-hole. and yet——”\\n\\n“yet what?”\\n\\n“a slight discrepancy, that is all! you noticed it? you did not?\\nstill, life is full of discrepancies, and assuredly the man cannot\\nhave taken his own life—there is no poison that would fill his\\nmouth with blood. no, no, i must resign myself to the fact that\\nall here is clear and above-board—but who is this?”\\n\\na tall young man was striding up the drive towards us. he passed\\nus without making any sign, but i noted that he was not ill-looking,\\nwith a lean, deeply bronzed face that spoke of life in a tropic\\nclime. a gardener who was sweeping up leaves had paused for a\\nminute in his task, and poirot ran quickly up to him.\\n\\n“tell me, i pray you, who is that gentleman? do you know him?”\\n\\n“i don’t remember his name, sir, though i did hear it. he was\\nstaying down here last week for a night. tuesday, it was.”\\n\\n“quick, _mon ami_, let us follow him.”\\n\\nwe hastened up the drive after the retreating figure. a glimpse of\\na black-robed figure on the terrace at the side of the house, and\\nour quarry swerved and we after him, so that we were witnesses of\\nthe meeting.\\n\\nmrs. maltravers almost staggered where she stood, and her face\\nblanched noticeably.\\n\\n“you,” she gasped. “i thought you were on the sea—on your way to\\neast africa?”\\n\\n“i got some news from my lawyers that detained me,” explained the\\nyoung man. “my old uncle in scotland died unexpectedly and left me\\nsome money. under the circumstances i thought it better to cancel\\nmy passage. then i saw this bad news in the paper and i came down\\nto see if there was anything i could do. you’ll want some one to\\nlook after things for you a bit perhaps.”\\n\\nat that moment they became aware of our presence. poirot stepped\\nforward, and with many apologies explained that he had left his\\nstick in the hall. rather reluctantly, it seemed to me, mrs.\\nmaltravers made the necessary introduction.\\n\\n“monsieur poirot, captain black.”\\n\\na few minutes’ chat ensued, in the course of which poirot elicited\\nthe fact that captain black was putting up at the anchor inn. the\\nmissing stick not having been discovered (which was not surprising),\\npoirot uttered more apologies and we withdrew.\\n\\nwe returned to the village at a great pace, and poirot made a bee\\nline for the anchor inn.\\n\\n“here we establish ourselves until our friend the captain returns,”\\nhe explained. “you notice that i emphasized the point that we were\\nreturning to london by the first train? possibly you thought i\\nmeant it. but no—you observed mrs. maltravers’ face when she caught\\nsight of this young black? she was clearly taken aback, and he—_eh\\nbien_, he was very devoted, did you not think so? and he was here\\non tuesday night—the day before mr. maltravers died. we must\\ninvestigate the doings of captain black, hastings.”\\n\\nin about half an hour we espied our quarry approaching the inn.\\npoirot went out and accosted him and presently brought him up to\\nthe room we had engaged.\\n\\n“i have been telling captain black of the mission which brings us\\nhere,” he explained. “you can understand, _monsieur le capitaine_,\\nthat i am anxious to arrive at mr. maltravers’ state of mind\\nimmediately before his death, and that at the same time i do not\\nwish to distress mrs. maltravers unduly by asking her painful\\nquestions. now, you were here just before the occurrence, and can\\ngive us equally valuable information.”\\n\\n“i’ll do anything i can to help you, i’m sure,” replied the young\\nsoldier; “but i’m afraid i didn’t notice anything out of the\\nordinary. you see, although maltravers was an old friend of my\\npeople’s, i didn’t know him very well myself.”\\n\\n“you came down—when?”\\n\\n“tuesday afternoon. i went up to town early wednesday morning, as\\nmy boat sailed from tilbury about twelve o’clock. but some news i\\ngot made me alter my plans, as i dare say you heard me explain to\\nmrs. maltravers.”\\n\\n“you were returning to east africa, i understand?”\\n\\n“yes. i’ve been out there ever since the war—a great country.”\\n\\n“exactly. now what was the talk about at dinner on tuesday night?”\\n\\n“oh, i don’t know. the usual odd topics. maltravers asked after my\\npeople, and then we discussed the question of german reparations,\\nand then mrs. maltravers asked a lot of questions about east\\nafrica, and i told them one or two yarns, that’s about all, i\\nthink.”\\n\\n“thank you.”\\n\\npoirot was silent for a moment, then he said gently: “with your\\npermission, i should like to try a little experiment. you have told\\nus all that your conscious self knows, i want now to question your\\nsubconscious self.”\\n\\n“psychoanalysis, what?” said black, with visible alarm.\\n\\n“oh, no,” said poirot reassuringly. “you see, it is like this, i\\ngive you a word, you answer with another, and so on. any word, the\\nfirst one you think of. shall we begin?”\\n\\n“all right,” said black slowly, but he looked uneasy.\\n\\n“note down the words, please, hastings,” said poirot. then he took\\nfrom his pocket his big turnip-faced watch and laid it on the table\\nbeside him. “we will commence. day.”\\n\\nthere was a moment’s pause, and then black replied:\\n\\n“_night_.”\\n\\nas poirot proceeded, his answers came quicker.\\n\\n“name,” said poirot.\\n\\n“_place_.”\\n\\n“bernard.”\\n\\n“_shaw_.”\\n\\n“tuesday.”\\n\\n“_dinner_.”\\n\\n“journey.”\\n\\n“_ship_.”\\n\\n“country.”\\n\\n“_uganda_.”\\n\\n“story.”\\n\\n“_lions_.”\\n\\n“rook rifle.”\\n\\n“_farm_.”\\n\\n“shot.”\\n\\n“_suicide_.”\\n\\n“elephant.”\\n\\n“_tusks_.”\\n\\n“money.”\\n\\n“_lawyers_.”\\n\\n“thank you, captain black. perhaps you could spare me a few minutes\\nin about half an hour’s time?”\\n\\n“certainly.” the young soldier looked at him curiously and wiped\\nhis brow as he got up.\\n\\n“and now, hastings,” said poirot, smiling at me as the door closed\\nbehind him. “you see it all, do you not?”\\n\\n“i don’t know what you mean.”\\n\\n“does that list of words tell you nothing?”\\n\\ni scrutinized it, but was forced to shake my head.\\n\\n“i will assist you. to begin with, black answered well within the\\nnormal time limit, with no pauses, so we can take it that he\\nhimself has no guilty knowledge to conceal. ‘day’ to ‘night’ and\\n‘place’ to ‘name’ are normal associations. i began work with\\n‘bernard’ which might have suggested the local doctor had he come\\nacross him at all. evidently he had not. after our recent\\nconversation, he gave ‘dinner’ to my ‘tuesday,’ but ‘journey’ and\\n‘country’ were answered by ‘ship’ and ‘uganda,’ showing clearly\\nthat it was his journey abroad that was important to him and not\\nthe one which brought him down here. ‘story’ recalls to him one of\\nthe ‘lion’ stories he told at dinner. i proceed to ‘rook rifle’\\nand he answered with the totally unexpected word ‘farm.’ when i\\nsay ‘shot,’ he answers at once ‘suicide.’ the association seems\\nclear. a man he knows committed suicide with a rook rifle on a farm\\nsomewhere. remember, too, that his mind is still on the stories he\\ntold at dinner, and i think you will agree that i shall not be far\\nfrom the truth if i recall captain black and ask him to repeat the\\nparticular suicide story which he told at the dinner-table on\\ntuesday evening.”\\n\\nblack was straightforward enough over the matter.\\n\\n“yes, i did tell them that story now that i come to think of it.\\nchap shot himself on a farm out there. did it with a rook rifle\\nthrough the roof of the mouth, bullet lodged in the brain. doctors\\nwere no end puzzled over it—there was nothing to show except a\\nlittle blood on the lips. but what——”\\n\\n“what has it got to do with mr. maltravers? you did not know, i\\nsee, that he was found with a rook rifle by his side.”\\n\\n“you mean my story suggested to him—oh, but that is awful!”\\n\\n“do not distress yourself—it would have been one way or another.\\nwell, i must get on the telephone to london.”\\n\\npoirot had a lengthy conversation over the wire, and came back\\nthoughtful. he went off by himself in the afternoon, and it was\\nnot till seven o’clock that he announced that he could put it off\\nno longer, but must break the news to the young widow. my sympathy\\nhad already gone out to her unreservedly. to be left penniless,\\nand with the knowledge that her husband had killed himself to\\nassure her future was a hard burden for any woman to bear. i\\ncherished a secret hope, however, that young black might prove\\ncapable of consoling her after her first grief had passed. he\\nevidently admired her enormously.\\n\\nour interview with the lady was painful. she refused vehemently to\\nbelieve the facts that poirot advanced, and when she was at last\\nconvinced broke down into bitter weeping. an examination of the\\nbody turned our suspicions into certainty. poirot was very sorry\\nfor the poor lady, but, after all, he was employed by the insurance\\ncompany, and what could he do? as he was preparing to leave he said\\ngently to mrs. maltravers:\\n\\n“madame, you of all people should know that there are no dead!”\\n\\n“what do you mean?” she faltered, her eyes growing wide.\\n\\n“have you never taken part in any spiritualistic séances? you are\\nmediumistic, you know.”\\n\\n“i have been told so. but you do not believe in spiritualism,\\nsurely?”\\n\\n“madame, i have seen some strange things. you know that they say\\nin the village that this house is haunted?”\\n\\nshe nodded, and at that moment the parlourmaid announced that\\ndinner was ready.\\n\\n“won’t you just stay and have something to eat?”\\n\\nwe accepted gratefully, and i felt that our presence could not but\\nhelp distract her a little from her own griefs.\\n\\nwe had just finished our soup, when there was a scream outside the\\ndoor, and the sound of breaking crockery. we jumped up. the\\nparlourmaid appeared, her hand to her heart.\\n\\n“it was a man—standing in the passage.”\\n\\npoirot rushed out, returning quickly.\\n\\n“there is no one there.”\\n\\n“isn’t there, sir?” said the parlourmaid weakly. “oh, it did give\\nme a start!”\\n\\n“but why?”\\n\\nshe dropped her voice to a whisper.\\n\\n“i thought—i thought it was the master—it looked like ’im.”\\n\\ni saw mrs. maltravers give a terrified start, and my mind flew to\\nthe old superstition that a suicide cannot rest. she thought of it\\ntoo, i am sure, for a minute later, she caught poirot’s arm with\\na scream.\\n\\n“didn’t you hear that? those three taps on the window? that’s how\\n_he_ always used to tap when he passed round the house.”\\n\\n“the ivy,” i cried. “it was the ivy against the pane.”\\n\\nbut a sort of terror was gaining on us all. the parlourmaid was\\nobviously unstrung, and when the meal was over mrs. maltravers\\nbesought poirot not to go at once. she was clearly terrified to be\\nleft alone. we sat in the little morning-room. the wind was getting\\nup, and moaning round the house in an eerie fashion. twice the door\\nof the room came unlatched and the door slowly opened, and each\\ntime she clung to me with a terrified gasp.\\n\\n“ah, but this door, it is bewitched!” cried\\n\\npoirot angrily at last. he got up and shut it once more, then\\nturned the key in the lock. “i shall lock it, so!”\\n\\n“don’t do that,” she gasped, “if it should come open now——”\\n\\nand even as she spoke the impossible happened. the locked door\\nslowly swung open. i could not see into the passage from where i\\nsat, but she and poirot were facing it. she gave one long shriek\\nas she turned to him.\\n\\n“you saw him—there in the passage?” she cried.\\n\\nhe was staring down at her with a puzzled face, then shook his\\nhead.\\n\\n“i saw him—my husband—you must have seen him too?”\\n\\n“madame, i saw nothing. you are not well—unstrung——”\\n\\n“i am perfectly well, i——oh, god!”\\n\\nsuddenly, without any warning, the lights quivered and went out.\\nout of the darkness came three loud raps. i could hear mrs.\\nmaltravers moaning.\\n\\nand then—i saw!\\n\\nthe man i had seen on the bed upstairs stood there facing us,\\ngleaming with a faint ghostly light. there was blood on his lips,\\nand he held his right hand out, pointing. suddenly a brilliant\\nlight seemed to proceed from it. it passed over poirot and me, and\\nfell on mrs. maltravers. i saw her white terrified face, and\\nsomething else!\\n\\n“my god, poirot!” i cried. “look at her hand, her right hand. it’s\\nall red!”\\n\\nher own eyes fell on it, and she collapsed in a heap on the floor.\\n\\n“blood,” she cried hysterically. “yes, it’s blood. i killed him.\\ni did it. he was showing me, and then i put my hand on the trigger\\nand pressed. save me from him—save me! he’s come back!”\\n\\nher voice died away in a gurgle.\\n\\n“lights,” said poirot briskly.\\n\\nthe lights went on as if by magic.\\n\\n“that’s it,” he continued. “you heard, hastings? and you, everett?\\noh, by the way, this is mr. everett, rather a fine member of the\\ntheatrical profession. i ’phoned to him this afternoon. his make-up\\nis good, isn’t it? quite like the dead man, and with a pocket torch\\nand the necessary phosphorescence he made the proper impression.\\ni shouldn’t touch her right hand if i were you, hastings. red paint\\nmarks so. when the lights went out i clasped her hand, you see. by\\nthe way, we mustn’t miss our train. inspector japp is outside the\\nwindow. a bad night—but he has been able to while away the time by\\ntapping on the window every now and then.”\\n\\n“you see,” continued poirot, as we walked briskly through the wind\\nand rain, “there was a little discrepancy. the doctor seemed to\\nthink the deceased was a christian scientist, and who could have\\ngiven him that impression but mrs. maltravers? but to us she\\nrepresented him as being in a grave state of apprehension about\\nhis own health. again, why was she so taken aback by the reappearance\\nof young black? and lastly, although i know that convention decrees\\nthat a woman must make a decent pretence of mourning for her\\nhusband, i do not care for such heavily-rouged eyelids! you did\\nnot observe them, hastings? no? as i always tell you, you see\\nnothing!”\\n\\n“well, there it was. there were the two possibilities. did black’s\\nstory suggest an ingenious method of committing suicide to mr.\\nmaltravers, or did his other listener, the wife, see an equally\\ningenious method of committing murder? i inclined to the latter\\nview. to shoot himself in the way indicated, he would probably have\\nhad to pull the trigger with his toe—or at least so i imagine.\\nnow if maltravers had been found with one boot off, we should\\nalmost certainly have heard of it from some one. an odd detail like\\nthat would have been remembered.\\n\\n“no, as i say, i inclined to the view that it was a case of murder,\\nnot suicide, but i realized that i had not a shadow of proof in\\nsupport of my theory. hence the elaborate little comedy you saw\\nplayed to-night.”\\n\\n“even now i don’t quite see all the details of the crime?” i said.\\n\\n“let us start from the beginning. here is a shrewd and scheming\\nwoman who, knowing of her husband’s financial _débâcle_ and tired\\nof the elderly mate she has only married for his money, induces\\nhim to insure his life for a large sum, and then seeks for the\\nmeans to accomplish her purpose. an accident gives her that—the\\nyoung soldier’s strange story. the next afternoon when _monsieur\\nle capitaine_, as she thinks, is on the high seas, she and her\\nhusband are strolling round the grounds. ‘what a curious story that\\nwas last night!’ she observes. ‘could a man shoot himself in such\\na way? do show me if it is possible!’ the poor fool—he shows her.\\nhe places the end of the rifle in his mouth. she stoops down, and\\nputs her finger on the trigger, laughing up at him. ‘and now, sir,’\\nshe says saucily, ‘supposing i pull the trigger?’\\n\\n“and then—and then, hastings—she pulls it!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  iii\\n\\n\\n  the adventure of the cheap flat\\n\\n\\nso far, in the cases which i have recorded, poirot’s investigations\\nhave started from the central fact, whether murder or robbery, and\\nhave proceeded from thence by a process of logical deduction to\\nthe final triumphant unravelling. in the events i am now about to\\nchronicle, a remarkable chain of circumstances led from the\\napparently trivial incidents which first attracted poirot’s\\nattention to the sinister happenings which completed a most unusual\\ncase.\\n\\ni had been spending the evening with an old friend of mine, gerald\\nparker. there had been, perhaps, about half a dozen people there\\nbesides my host and myself, and the talk fell, as it was bound to\\ndo sooner or later wherever parker found himself, on the subject\\nof house-hunting in london. houses and flats were parker’s special\\nhobby. since the end of the war, he had occupied at least half a\\ndozen different flats and maisonnettes. no sooner was he settled\\nanywhere than he would light unexpectedly upon a new find, and\\nwould forthwith depart bag and baggage. his moves were nearly\\nalways accomplished at a slight pecuniary gain, for he had a shrewd\\nbusiness head, but it was sheer love of the sport that actuated\\nhim, and not a desire to make money at it. we listened to parker\\nfor some time with the respect of the novice for the expert. then\\nit was our turn, and a perfect babel of tongues was let loose.\\nfinally the floor was left to mrs. robinson, a charming little\\nbride who was there with her husband. i had never met them before,\\nas robinson was only a recent acquaintance of parker’s.\\n\\n“talking of flats,” she said, “have you heard of our piece of luck,\\nmr. parker? we’ve got a flat—at last! in montagu mansions.”\\n\\n“well,” said parker, “i’ve always said there are plenty of flats—at\\na price!”\\n\\n“yes, but this isn’t at a price. it’s dirt cheap. eighty pounds a\\nyear!”\\n\\n“but—but montagu mansions is just off knightsbridge, isn’t it? big\\nhandsome building. or are you talking of a poor relation of the\\nsame name stuck in the slums somewhere?”\\n\\n“no, it’s the knightsbridge one. that’s what makes it so wonderful.”\\n\\n“wonderful is the word! it’s a blinking miracle. but there must be\\na catch somewhere. big premium, i suppose?”\\n\\n“no premium!”\\n\\n“no prem—oh, hold my head, somebody!” groaned parker.\\n\\n“but we’ve got to buy the furniture,” continued mrs. robinson.\\n\\n“ah!” parker brisked up. “i knew there was a catch!”\\n\\n“for fifty pounds. and it’s beautifully furnished!”\\n\\n“i give it up,” said parker. “the present occupants must be lunatics\\nwith a taste for philanthropy.”\\n\\nmrs. robinson was looking a little troubled. a little pucker\\nappeared between her dainty brows.\\n\\n“it _is_ queer, isn’t it? you don’t think that—that—the place is\\n_haunted_?”\\n\\n“never heard of a haunted flat,” declared parker decisively.\\n\\n“n-o.” mrs. robinson appeared far from convinced. “but there were\\nseveral things about it all that struck me as—well, queer.”\\n\\n“for instance——” i suggested.\\n\\n“ah,” said parker, “our criminal expert’s attention is aroused!\\nunburden yourself to him, mrs. robinson. hastings is a great\\nunraveller of mysteries.”\\n\\ni laughed, embarrassed but not wholly displeased with the rôle\\nthrust upon me.\\n\\n“oh, not really queer, captain hastings, but when we went to the\\nagents, stosser and paul—we hadn’t tried them before because they\\nonly have the expensive mayfair flats, but we thought at any rate\\nit would do no harm—everything they offered us was four and five\\nhundred a year, or else huge premiums, and then, just as we were\\ngoing, they mentioned that they had a flat at eighty, but that they\\ndoubted if it would be any good our going there, because it had\\nbeen on their books some time and they had sent so many people to\\nsee it that it was almost sure to be taken—‘snapped up’ as the\\nclerk put it—only people were so tiresome in not letting them know,\\nand then they went on sending, and people get annoyed at being sent\\nto a place that had, perhaps, been let some time.”\\n\\nmrs. robinson paused for some much needed breath, and then\\ncontinued: “we thanked him, and said that we quite\\nunderstood it would probably be no good, but that we should\\nlike an order all the same—just in case. and we went there\\nstraight away in a taxi, for, after all, you never know. no.\\n4 was on the second floor, and just as we were waiting for\\nthe lift, elsie ferguson—she’s a friend of mine, captain\\nhastings, and they are looking for a flat too—came hurrying\\ndown the stairs. ‘ahead of you for once, my dear,’ she said.\\n‘but it’s no good. it’s already let.’ that seemed to finish\\nit, but—well, as john said, the place was very cheap, we\\ncould afford to give more, and perhaps if we offered a\\npremium.——a horrid thing to do, of course, and i feel quite\\nashamed of telling you, but you know what flat-hunting is.”\\n\\ni assured her that i was well aware that in the struggle for\\nhouse-room the baser side of human nature frequently triumphed over\\nthe higher, and that the well-known rule of dog eat dog always\\napplied.\\n\\n“so we went up and, would you believe it, the flat wasn’t let at\\nall. we were shown over it by the maid, and then we saw the\\nmistress, and the thing was settled then and there. immediate\\npossession and fifty pounds for the furniture. we signed the\\nagreement next day, and we are to move in to-morrow!” mrs. robinson\\npaused triumphantly.\\n\\n“and what about mrs. ferguson?” asked parker. “let’s have your\\ndeductions, hastings.”\\n\\n“‘obvious, my dear watson,’” i quoted lightly. “she went to the\\nwrong flat.”\\n\\n“oh, captain hastings, how clever of you!” cried mrs. robinson\\nadmiringly.\\n\\ni rather wished poirot had been there. sometimes i have the feeling\\nthat he rather underestimates my capabilities.\\n\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\n\\nthe whole thing was rather amusing, and i propounded the thing as\\na mock problem to poirot on the following morning. he seemed\\ninterested, and questioned me rather narrowly as to the rents of\\nflats in various localities.\\n\\n“a curious story,” he said thoughtfully. “excuse me, hastings, i\\nmust take a short stroll.”\\n\\nwhen he returned, about an hour later, his eyes were gleaming with\\na peculiar excitement. he laid his stick on the table, and brushed\\nthe nap of his hat with his usual tender care before he spoke.\\n\\n“it is as well, _mon ami_, that we have no affairs of moment on\\nhand. we can devote ourselves wholly to the present investigation.”\\n\\n“what investigation are you talking about?”\\n\\n“the remarkable cheapness of your friend’s, mrs. robinson’s, new\\nflat.”\\n\\n“poirot, you are not serious!”\\n\\n“i am most serious. figure to yourself, my friend, that the real\\nrent of those flats is £350. i have just ascertained that from the\\nlandlord’s agents. and yet this particular flat is being sublet at\\neighty pounds! why?”\\n\\n“there must be something wrong with it. perhaps it is haunted, as\\nmrs. robinson suggested.”\\n\\npoirot shook his head in a dissatisfied manner.\\n\\n“then again how curious it is that her friend tells her the flat\\nis let, and, when she goes up, behold, it is not so at all!”\\n\\n“but surely you agree with me that the other woman must have gone\\nto the wrong flat. that is the only possible solution.”\\n\\n“you may or may not be right on that point, hastings. the fact\\nstill remains that numerous other applicants were sent to see it,\\nand yet, in spite of its remarkable cheapness, it was still in the\\nmarket when mrs. robinson arrived.”\\n\\n“that shows that there must be something wrong about it.”\\n\\n“mrs. robinson did not seem to notice anything amiss. very curious,\\nis it not? did she impress you as being a truthful woman, hastings?”\\n\\n“she was a delightful creature!”\\n\\n“_évidemment!_ since she renders you incapable of replying to my\\nquestion. describe her to me, then.”\\n\\n“well, she’s tall and fair; her hair’s really a beautiful shade of\\nauburn——”\\n\\n“always you have had a penchant for auburn hair!” murmured poirot.\\n“but continue.”\\n\\n“blue eyes and a very nice complexion and—well, that’s all, i\\nthink,” i concluded lamely.\\n\\n“and her husband?”\\n\\n“oh, he’s quite a nice fellow—nothing startling.”\\n\\n“dark or fair?”\\n\\n“i don’t know—betwixt and between, and just an ordinary sort of\\nface.”\\n\\npoirot nodded.\\n\\n“yes, there are hundreds of these average men—and, anyway, you\\nbring more sympathy and appreciation to your description of women.\\ndo you know anything about these people? does parker know them\\nwell.”\\n\\n“they are just recent acquaintances, i believe. but surely, poirot,\\nyou don’t think for an instant——”\\n\\npoirot raised his hand.\\n\\n“_tout doucement, mon ami_. have i said that i think anything? all\\ni say is—it is a curious story. and there is nothing to throw light\\nupon it; except perhaps the lady’s name, eh, hastings?”\\n\\n“her name is stella,” i said stiffly, “but i don’t see——”\\n\\npoirot interrupted me with a tremendous chuckle. something seemed\\nto be amusing him vastly.\\n\\n“and stella means a star, does it not? famous!”\\n\\n“what on earth——”\\n\\n“and stars give light! _voilà!_ calm yourself, hastings. do not\\nput on that air of injured dignity. come, we will go to montagu\\nmansions and make a few inquiries.”\\n\\ni accompanied him, nothing loath. the mansions were a handsome\\nblock of buildings in excellent repair. a uniformed porter was\\nsunning himself on the threshold, and it was to him that poirot\\naddressed himself:\\n\\n“pardon, but could you tell me if a mr. and mrs. robinson reside\\nhere?”\\n\\nthe porter was a man of few words and apparently of a sour or\\nsuspicious disposition. he hardly looked at us and grunted out:\\n\\n“no. 4. second floor.”\\n\\n“i thank you. can you tell me how long they have been here?”\\n\\n“six months.”\\n\\ni started forward in amazement, conscious as i did so of poirot’s\\nmalicious grin.\\n\\n“impossible,” i cried. “you must be making a mistake.”\\n\\n“six months.”\\n\\n“are you sure? the lady i mean is tall and fair with reddish gold\\nhair and——”\\n\\n“that’s ’er,” said the porter. “come in the michaelmas quarter,\\nthey did. just six months ago.”\\n\\nhe appeared to lose interest in us and retreated slowly up the\\nhall. i followed poirot outside.\\n\\n“_eh bien_, hastings?” my friend demanded slyly. “are you so sure\\nnow that delightful women always speak the truth?”\\n\\ni did not reply.\\n\\npoirot had steered his way into brompton road before i asked him\\nwhat he was going to do and where we were going.\\n\\n“to the house agents, hastings. i have a great desire to have a\\nflat in montagu mansions. if i am not mistaken, several interesting\\nthings will take place there before long.”\\n\\nwe were fortunate in our quest. no. 8, on the fourth floor, was to\\nbe let furnished at ten guineas a week. poirot promptly took it\\nfor a month. outside in the street again, he silenced my protests:\\n\\n“but i make money nowadays! why should i not indulge a whim? by\\nthe way, hastings, have you a revolver?”\\n\\n“yes—somewhere,” i answered, slightly thrilled. “do you think——”\\n\\n“that you will need it? it is quite possible. the idea pleases you,\\ni see. always the spectacular and romantic appeals to you.”\\n\\nthe following day saw us installed in our temporary home. the flat\\nwas pleasantly furnished. it occupied the same position in the\\nbuilding as that of the robinsons, but was two floors higher.\\n\\nthe day after our installation was a sunday. in the afternoon,\\npoirot left the front door ajar, and summoned me hastily as a bang\\nreverberated from somewhere below.\\n\\n“look over the banisters. are those your friends. do not let them\\nsee you.”\\n\\ni craned my neck over the staircase.\\n\\n“that’s them,” i declared in an ungrammatical whisper.\\n\\n“good. wait awhile.”\\n\\nabout half an hour later, a young woman emerged in brilliant and\\nvaried clothing. with a sigh of satisfaction, poirot tiptoed back\\ninto the flat.\\n\\n“_c’est ça_. after the master and mistress, the maid. the flat\\nshould now be empty.”\\n\\n“what are we going to do?” i asked uneasily.\\n\\npoirot had trotted briskly into the scullery and was hauling at\\nthe rope of the coal-lift.\\n\\n“we are about to descend after the method of the dustbins,” he\\nexplained cheerfully. “no one will observe us. the sunday concert,\\nthe sunday ‘afternoon out,’ and finally the sunday nap after the\\nsunday dinner of england—_le rosbif_—all these will distract\\nattention from the doings of hercule poirot. come, my friend.”\\n\\nhe stepped into the rough wooden contrivance and i followed him\\ngingerly.\\n\\n“are we going to break into the flat?” i asked dubiously.\\n\\npoirot’s answer was not too reassuring:\\n\\n“not precisely to-day,” he replied.\\n\\npulling on the rope, we descended slowly till we reached the second\\nfloor. poirot uttered an exclamation of satisfaction as he perceived\\nthat the wooden door into the scullery was open.\\n\\n“you observe? never do they bolt these doors in the daytime. and\\nyet anyone could mount or descend as we have done. at night\\nyes—though not always then—and it is against that that we are going\\nto make provision.”\\n\\nhe had drawn some tools from his pocket as he spoke, and at once\\nset deftly to work, his object being to arrange the bolt so that\\nit could be pulled back from the lift. the operation only occupied\\nabout three minutes. then poirot returned the tools to his pocket,\\nand we reascended once more to our own domain.\\n\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\n\\non monday poirot was out all day, but when he returned in the\\nevening he flung himself into his chair with a sigh of satisfaction.\\n\\n“hastings, shall i recount to you a little history? a story after\\nyour own heart and which will remind you of your favourite cinema?”\\n\\n“go ahead,” i laughed. “i presume that it is a true story, not one\\nof your efforts of fancy.”\\n\\n“it is true enough. inspector japp of scotland yard will vouch for\\nits accuracy, since it was through his kind offices that it came\\nto my ears. listen, hastings. a little over six months ago some\\nimportant naval plans were stolen from an american government\\ndepartment. they showed the position of some of the most important\\nharbour defences, and would be worth a considerable sum to any\\nforeign government—that of japan, for example. suspicion fell upon\\na young man named luigi valdarno, an italian by birth, who was\\nemployed in a minor capacity in the department and who was missing\\nat the same time as the papers. whether luigi valdarno was the\\nthief or not, he was found two days later on the east side in new\\nyork, shot dead. the papers were not on him. now for some time past\\nluigi valdarno had been going about with a miss elsa hardt, a young\\nconcert singer who had recently appeared and who lived with a\\nbrother in an apartment in washington. nothing was known of the\\nantecedents of miss elsa hardt, and she disappeared suddenly about\\nthe time of valdarno’s death. there are reasons for believing that\\nshe was in reality an accomplished international spy who has done\\nmuch nefarious work under various _aliases_. the american secret\\nservice, whilst doing their best to trace her, also kept an eye\\nupon certain insignificant japanese gentlemen living in washington.\\nthey felt pretty certain that, when elsa hardt had covered her\\ntracks sufficiently, she would approach the gentlemen in question.\\none of them left suddenly for england a fortnight ago. on the face\\nof it, therefore, it would seem that elsa hardt is in england.”\\npoirot paused, and then added softly: “the official description of\\nelsa hardt is: height 5 ft. 7, eyes blue, hair auburn, fair\\ncomplexion, nose straight, no special distinguishing marks.”\\n\\n“mrs. robinson!” i gasped.\\n\\n“well, there is a chance of it, anyhow,” amended poirot. “also, i\\nlearn that a swarthy man, a foreigner of some kind, was inquiring\\nabout the occupants of no. 4 only this morning. therefore, _mon\\nami_, i fear that you must forswear your beauty sleep to-night,\\nand join me in my all-night vigil in the flat below—armed with that\\nexcellent revolver of yours, _bien entendu_!”\\n\\n“rather,” i cried with enthusiasm. “when shall we start?”\\n\\n“the hour of midnight is both solemn and suitable, i fancy. nothing\\nis likely to occur before then.”\\n\\nat twelve o’clock precisely, we crept cautiously into the coal-lift\\nand lowered ourselves to the second floor. under poirot’s\\nmanipulation, the wooden door quickly swung inwards, and we climbed\\ninto the flat. from the scullery we passed into the kitchen where\\nwe established ourselves comfortably in two chairs with the door\\ninto the hall ajar.\\n\\n“now we have but to wait,” said poirot contentedly, closing his\\neyes.\\n\\nto me, the waiting appeared endless. i was terrified of going to\\nsleep. just when it seemed to me that i had been there about eight\\nhours—and had, as i found out afterwards, in reality been exactly\\none hour and twenty minutes—a faint scratching sound came to my\\nears. poirot’s hand touched mine. i rose, and together we moved\\ncarefully in the direction of the hall. the noise came from there.\\npoirot placed his lips to my ear.\\n\\n“outside the front door. they are cutting out the lock. when i give\\nthe word, not before, fall upon him from behind and hold him fast.\\nbe careful, he will have a knife.”\\n\\npresently there was a rending sound, and a little circle of light\\nappeared through the door. it was extinguished immediately and then\\nthe door was slowly opened. poirot and i flattened ourselves\\nagainst the wall. i heard a man’s breathing as he passed us. then\\nhe flashed on his torch, and as he did so, poirot hissed in my ear:\\n\\n“_allez_.”\\n\\nwe sprang together, poirot with a quick movement enveloped the\\nintruder’s head with a light woollen scarf whilst i pinioned his\\narms. the whole affair was quick and noiseless. i twisted a dagger\\nfrom his hand, and as poirot brought down the scarf from his eyes,\\nwhilst keeping it wound tightly round his mouth, i jerked up my\\nrevolver where he could see it and understand that resistance was\\nuseless. as he ceased to struggle poirot put his mouth close to\\nhis ear and began to whisper rapidly. after a minute the man\\nnodded. then enjoining silence with a movement of the hand, poirot\\nled the way out of the flat and down the stairs. our captive\\nfollowed, and i brought up the rear with the revolver. when we were\\nout in the street, poirot turned to me.\\n\\n“there is a taxi waiting just round the corner. give me the\\nrevolver. we shall not need it now.”\\n\\n“but if this fellow tries to escape?”\\n\\npoirot smiled.\\n\\n“he will not.”\\n\\ni returned in a minute with the waiting taxi. the scarf had been\\nunwound from the stranger’s face, and i gave a start of surprise.\\n\\n“he’s not a jap,” i ejaculated in a whisper to poirot.\\n\\n“observation was always your strong point, hastings! nothing\\nescapes you. no, the man is not a jap. he is an italian.”\\n\\nwe got into the taxi, and poirot gave the driver an address in st.\\njohn’s wood. i was by now completely fogged. i did not like to ask\\npoirot where we were going in front of our captive, and strove in\\nvain to obtain some light upon the proceedings.\\n\\nwe alighted at the door of a small house standing back from the\\nroad. a returning wayfarer, slightly drunk, was lurching along the\\npavement and almost collided with poirot, who said something\\nsharply to him which i did not catch. all three of us went up the\\nsteps of the house. poirot rang the bell and motioned us to stand\\na little aside. there was no answer and he rang again and then\\nseized the knocker which he plied for some minutes vigorously.\\n\\na light appeared suddenly above the fanlight, and the door was\\nopened cautiously a little way.\\n\\n“what the devil do you want?” a man’s voice demanded harshly.\\n\\n“i want the doctor. my wife is taken ill.”\\n\\n“there’s no doctor here.”\\n\\nthe man prepared to shut the door, but poirot thrust his foot in\\nadroitly. he became suddenly a perfect caricature of an infuriated\\nfrenchman.\\n\\n“what you say, there is no doctor? i will have the law of you. you\\nmust come! i will stay here and ring and knock all night.”\\n\\n“my dear sir——” the door was opened again, the man, clad in a\\ndressing-gown and slippers, stepped forward to pacify poirot with\\nan uneasy glance round.\\n\\n“i will call the police.”\\n\\npoirot prepared to descend the steps.\\n\\n“no, don’t do that for heaven’s sake!” the man dashed after him.\\n\\nwith a neat push poirot sent him staggering down the steps. in\\nanother minute all three of us were inside the door and it was\\npushed to and bolted.\\n\\n“quick—in here.” poirot led the way into the nearest room switching\\non the light as he did so. “and you—behind the curtain.”\\n\\n“si, signor,” said the italian and slid rapidly behind the full\\nfolds of rose-coloured velvet which draped the embrasure of the\\nwindow.\\n\\nnot a minute too soon. just as he disappeared from view a woman\\nrushed into the room. she was tall with reddish hair and held a\\nscarlet kimono round her slender form.\\n\\n“where is my husband?” she cried, with a quick frightened glance.\\n“who are you?”\\n\\npoirot stepped forward with a bow.\\n\\n“it is to be hoped your husband will not suffer from a chill. i\\nobserved that he had slippers on his feet, and that his dressing-gown\\nwas a warm one.”\\n\\n“who are you? what are you doing in my house?”\\n\\n“it is true that none of us have the pleasure of your acquaintance,\\nmadame. it is especially to be regretted as one of our number has\\ncome specially from new york in order to meet you.”\\n\\nthe curtains parted and the italian stepped out. to my horror i\\nobserved that he was brandishing my revolver, which poirot must\\ndoubtless have put down through inadvertence in the cab.\\n\\nthe woman gave a piercing scream and turned to fly, but poirot was\\nstanding in front of the closed door.\\n\\n“let me by,” she shrieked. “he will murder me.”\\n\\n“who was it dat croaked luigi valdarno?” asked the italian hoarsely,\\nbrandishing the weapon, and sweeping each one of us with it. we\\ndared not move.\\n\\n“my god, poirot, this is awful. what shall we do?” i cried.\\n\\n“you will oblige me by refraining from talking so much, hastings.\\ni can assure you that our friend will not shoot until i give the\\nword.”\\n\\n“youse sure o’ dat, eh?” said the italian, leering unpleasantly.\\n\\nit was more than i was, but the woman turned to poirot like a\\nflash.\\n\\n“what is it you want?”\\n\\npoirot bowed.\\n\\n“i do not think it is necessary to insult miss elsa hardt’s\\nintelligence by telling her.”\\n\\nwith a swift movement, the woman snatched up a big black velvet\\ncat which served as a cover for the telephone.\\n\\n“they are stitched in the lining of that.”\\n\\n“clever,” murmured poirot appreciatively. he stood aside from the\\ndoor. “good evening, madame. i will detain your friend from new\\nyork whilst you make your getaway.”\\n\\n“whatta fool!” roared the big italian, and raising the revolver he\\nfired point-blank at the woman’s retreating figure just as i flung\\nmyself upon him.\\n\\nbut the weapon merely clicked harmlessly and poirot’s voice rose\\nin mild reproof.\\n\\n“never will you trust your old friend, hastings. i do not care for\\nmy friends to carry loaded pistols about with them and never would\\ni permit a mere acquaintance to do so. no, no, _mon ami_.” this to\\nthe italian who swearing hoarsely. poirot continued to address him\\nin a tone of mild reproof: “see now, what i have done for you. i\\nhave saved you from being hanged. and do not think that our\\nbeautiful lady will escape. no, no, the house is watched, back and\\nfront. straight into the arms of the police they will go. is not\\nthat a beautiful and consoling thought? yes, you may leave the room\\nnow. but be careful—be very careful. i——ah, he is gone! and my\\nfriend hastings looks at me with eyes of reproach. but it was all\\nso simple! it was clear, from the first, that out of several\\nhundred, probably, applicants for no. 4, montagu mansions only the\\nrobinsons were considered suitable. why? what was there that\\nsingled them out from the rest—at practically a glance. their\\nappearance? possibly, but it was not so unusual. their name, then!”\\n\\n“but there’s nothing unusual about the name of robinson,” i cried.\\n“it’s quite a common name.”\\n\\n“ah! _sapristi_, but exactly! that was the point. elsa hardt and\\nher husband, or brother or whatever he really is, come from new\\nyork, and take a flat in the name of mr. and mrs. robinson. suddenly\\nthey learn that one of these secret societies, the mafia, or the\\ncamorra, to which doubtless luigi valdarno belonged, is on their\\ntrack. what do they do? they hit on a scheme of transparent\\nsimplicity. evidently they knew that their pursuers were not\\npersonally acquainted with either of them. what then can be simpler?\\nthey offer the flat at an absurdly low rental. of the thousands of\\nyoung couples in london looking for flats, there cannot fail to be\\nseveral robinsons. it is only a matter of waiting. if you will look\\nat the name of robinson in the telephone directory, you will\\nrealize that a fair-haired mrs. robinson was pretty sure to come\\nalong sooner or later. then what will happen? the avenger arrives.\\nhe knows the name, he knows the address. he strikes! all is over,\\nvengeance is satisfied, and miss elsa hardt has escaped by the skin\\nof her teeth once more. by the way, hastings, you must present me\\nto the real mrs. robinson—that delightful and truthful creature!\\nwhat will they think when they find their flat has been broken\\ninto! we must hurry back. ah, that sounds like japp and his friends\\narriving.”\\n\\na mighty tattoo sounded on the knocker.\\n\\n“how did you know this address?” i asked as i followed poirot out\\ninto the hall. “oh, of course, you had the first mrs. robinson\\nfollowed when she left the other flat.”\\n\\n“_a la bonne heure_, hastings. you use your grey cells at last.\\nnow for a little surprise for japp.”\\n\\nsoftly unbolting the door, he stuck the cat’s head round the edge\\nand ejaculated a piercing “miaow.”\\n\\nthe scotland yard inspector, who was standing outside with another\\nman, jumped in spite of himself.\\n\\n“oh, it’s only monsieur poirot at one of his little jokes!” he\\nexclaimed, as poirot’s head followed that of the cat. “let us in,\\nmoosior.”\\n\\n“you have our friends safe and sound?”\\n\\n“yes, we’ve got the birds all right. but they hadn’t got the goods\\nwith them.”\\n\\n“i see. so you come to search. well, i am about to depart with\\nhastings, but i should like to give you a little lecture upon the\\nhistory and habits of the domestic cat.”\\n\\n“for the lord’s sake, have you gone completely balmy?”\\n\\n“the cat,” declaimed poirot, “was worshipped by the ancient\\negyptians. it is still regarded as a symbol of good luck if a black\\ncat crosses your path. this cat crossed your path to-night, japp.\\nto speak of the interior of any animal or any person is not, i\\nknow, considered polite in england. but the interior of this cat\\nis perfectly delicate. i refer to the lining.”\\n\\nwith a sudden grunt, the second man seized the cat from poirot’s\\nhand.\\n\\n“oh, i forgot to introduce you,” said japp. “mr. poirot, this is\\nmr. burt of the united states secret service.”\\n\\nthe american’s trained fingers had felt what he was looking for.\\nhe held out his hand, and for a moment speech failed him. then he\\nrose to the occasion.\\n\\n“pleased to meet you,” said mr. burt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  iv\\n\\n\\n  the mystery of hunter’s lodge\\n\\n\\n“after all,” murmured poirot, “it is possible that i shall not die\\nthis time.”\\n\\ncoming from a convalescent influenza patient, i hailed the remark\\nas showing a beneficial optimism. i myself had been the first\\nsufferer from the disease. poirot in his turn had gone down. he\\nwas now sitting up in bed, propped up with pillows, his head\\nmuffled in a woollen shawl, and was slowly sipping a particularly\\nnoxious tisane which i had prepared according to his directions.\\nhis eye rested with pleasure upon a neatly graduated row of medicine\\nbottles which adorned the mantelpiece.\\n\\n“yes, yes,” my little friend continued. “once more shall i be\\nmyself again, the great hercule poirot, the terror of evil-doers!\\nfigure to yourself, _mon ami_, that i have a little paragraph to\\nmyself in _society gossip_. but yes! here it is! ‘go it—criminals—all\\nout! hercule poirot—and believe me, girls, he’s some hercules!—our\\nown pet society detective can’t get a grip on you. ’cause why?\\n’cause he’s got _la grippe_ himself’!”\\n\\ni laughed.\\n\\n“good for you, poirot. you are becoming quite a public character.\\nand fortunately you haven’t missed anything of particular interest\\nduring this time.”\\n\\n“that is true. the few cases i have had to decline did not fill me\\nwith any regret.”\\n\\nour landlady stuck her head in at the door.\\n\\n“there’s a gentleman downstairs. says he must see monsieur poirot\\nor you, captain. seeing as he was in a great to-do—and with all\\nthat quite the gentleman—i brought up ’is card.”\\n\\nshe handed me the bit of pasteboard. “mr. roger havering,” i read.\\n\\npoirot motioned with his head towards the bookcase, and i obediently\\npulled forth “who’s who.” poirot took it from me and scanned the\\npages rapidly.\\n\\n“second son of fifth baron windsor. married 1913 zoe, fourth\\ndaughter of william crabb.”\\n\\n“h’m!” i said. “i rather fancy that’s the girl who used to act at\\nthe frivolity—only she called herself zoe carrisbrook. i remember\\nshe married some young man about town just before the war.”\\n\\n“would it interest you, hastings, to go down and hear what our\\nvisitor’s particular little trouble is? make him all my excuses.”\\n\\nroger havering was a man of about forty, well set up and of smart\\nappearance. his face, however, was haggard, and he was evidently\\nlabouring under great agitation.\\n\\n“captain hastings? you are monsieur poirot’s partner, i understand.\\nit is imperative that he should come with me to derbyshire to-day.”\\n\\n“i’m afraid that’s impossible,” i replied. “poirot is ill in\\nbed—influenza.”\\n\\nhis face fell.\\n\\n“dear me, that is a great blow to me.”\\n\\n“the matter on which you want to consult him is serious?”\\n\\n“my god, yes! my uncle, the best friend i have in the world, was\\nfoully murdered last night.”\\n\\n“here in london?”\\n\\n“no, in derbyshire. i was in town and received a telegram from my\\nwife this morning. immediately upon its receipt i determined to\\ncome round and beg monsieur poirot to undertake the case.”\\n\\n“if you will excuse me a minute,” i said, struck by a sudden idea.\\n\\ni rushed upstairs, and in a few brief words acquainted poirot with\\nthe situation. he took any further words out of my mouth.\\n\\n“i see. i see. you want to go yourself, is it not so? well, why\\nnot? you should know my methods by now. all i ask is that you\\nshould report to me fully every day, and follow implicitly any\\ninstructions i may wire you.”\\n\\nto this i willingly agreed.\\n\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\n\\nan hour later i was sitting opposite mr. havering in a first-class\\ncarriage on the midland railway, speeding rapidly away from london.\\n\\n“to begin with, captain hastings, you must understand that hunter’s\\nlodge, where we are going, and where the tragedy took place, is\\nonly a small shooting-box in the heart of the derbyshire moors.\\nour real home is near newmarket, and we usually rent a flat in town\\nfor the season. hunter’s lodge is looked after by a housekeeper\\nwho is quite capable of doing all we need when we run down for an\\noccasional week-end. of course, during the shooting season, we take\\ndown some of our own servants from newmarket. my uncle, mr.\\nharrington pace (as you may know, my mother was a miss pace of new\\nyork), has, for the last three years, made his home with us. he\\nnever got on well with my father, or my elder brother, and i\\nsuspect that my being somewhat of a prodigal son myself rather\\nincreased than diminished his affection towards me. of course i am\\na poor man, and my uncle was a rich one—in other words, he paid\\nthe piper! but, though exacting in many ways, he was not really\\nhard to get on with, and we all three lived very harmoniously\\ntogether. two days ago my uncle, rather wearied with some recent\\ngaieties of ours in town, suggested that we should run down to\\nderbyshire for a day or two. my wife telegraphed to mrs. middleton,\\nthe housekeeper, and we went down that same afternoon. yesterday\\nevening i was forced to return to town, but my wife and my uncle\\nremained on. this morning i received this telegram.” he handed it\\nover to me:\\n\\n“come at once uncle harrington murdered last night bring good\\ndetective if you can but do come—zoe.”\\n\\n“then, as yet you know no details?”\\n\\n“no, i suppose it will be in the evening papers. without doubt the\\npolice are in charge.”\\n\\nit was about three o’clock when we arrived at the little station\\nof elmer’s dale. from there a five-mile drive brought us to a small\\ngrey stone building in the midst of the rugged moors.\\n\\n“a lonely place,” i observed with a shiver.\\n\\nhavering nodded.\\n\\n“i shall try and get rid of it. i could never live here again.”\\n\\nwe unlatched the gate and were walking up the narrow path to the\\noak door when a familiar figure emerged and came to meet us.\\n\\n“japp!” i ejaculated.\\n\\nthe scotland yard inspector grinned at me in a friendly fashion\\nbefore addressing my companion.\\n\\n“mr. havering, i think? i’ve been sent down from london to take\\ncharge of this case, and i’d like a word with you, if i may, sir.”\\n\\n“my wife——”\\n\\n“i’ve seen your good lady, sir—and the housekeeper. i won’t keep\\nyou a moment, but i’m anxious to get back to the village now that\\ni’ve seen all there is to see here.”\\n\\n“i know nothing as yet as to what——”\\n\\n“ex-actly,” said japp soothingly. “but there are just one or two\\nlittle points i’d like your opinion about all the same. captain\\nhastings here, he knows me, and he’ll go on up to the house and\\ntell them you’re coming. what have you done with the little man,\\nby the way, captain hastings?”\\n\\n“he’s ill in bed with influenza.”\\n\\n“is he now? i’m sorry to hear that. rather the case of the cart\\nwithout the horse, your being here without him, isn’t it?”\\n\\nand on his rather ill-timed jest i went on to the house. i rang\\nthe bell, as japp had closed the door behind him. after some\\nmoments it was opened to me by a middle-aged woman in black.\\n\\n“mr. havering will be here in a moment,” i explained. “he has been\\ndetained by the inspector. i have come down with him from london\\nto look into the case. perhaps you can tell me briefly what occurred\\nlast night.”\\n\\n“come inside, sir.” she closed the door behind me, and we stood in\\nthe dimly-lighted hall. “it was after dinner last night, sir, that\\nthe man came. he asked to see mr. pace, sir, and, seeing that he\\nspoke the same way, i thought it was an american gentleman friend\\nof mr. pace’s and i showed him into the gun-room, and then went to\\ntell mr. pace. he wouldn’t give any name, which, of course, was a\\nbit odd, now i come to think of it. i told mr. pace, and he seemed\\npuzzled like, but he said to the mistress: ‘excuse me, zoe, while\\ni just see what this fellow wants.’ he went off to the gun-room,\\nand i went back to the kitchen, but after a while i heard loud\\nvoices, as if they were quarrelling, and i came out into the hall.\\nat the same time, the mistress she comes out too, and just then\\nthere was a shot and then a dreadful silence. we both ran to the\\ngun-room door, but it was locked and we had to go round to the\\nwindow. it was open, and there inside was mr. pace, all shot and\\nbleeding.”\\n\\n“what became of the man?”\\n\\n“he must have got away through the window, sir, before we got to\\nit.”\\n\\n“and then?”\\n\\n“mrs. havering sent me to fetch the police. five miles to walk it\\nwas. they came back with me, and the constable he stayed all night,\\nand this morning the police gentleman from london arrived.”\\n\\n“what was this man like who called to see mr. pace?”\\n\\nthe housekeeper reflected.\\n\\n“he had a black beard, sir, and was about middle-aged, and had on\\na light overcoat. beyond the fact that he spoke like an american\\ni didn’t notice much about him.”\\n\\n“i see. now i wonder if i can see mrs. havering?”\\n\\n“she’s upstairs, sir. shall i tell her?”\\n\\n“if you please. tell her that mr. havering is outside with inspector\\njapp, and that the gentleman he has brought back with him from\\nlondon is anxious to speak to her as soon as possible.”\\n\\n“very good, sir.”\\n\\ni was in a fever of impatience to get at all the facts. japp had\\ntwo or three hours’ start of me, and his anxiety to be gone made\\nme keen to be close at his heels.\\n\\nmrs. havering did not keep me waiting long. in a few minutes i\\nheard a light step descending the stairs, and looked up to see a\\nvery handsome young woman coming towards me. she wore a\\nflame-coloured jumper, that set off the slender boyishness of her\\nfigure. on her dark head was a little hat of flame-coloured leather.\\neven the present tragedy could not dim the vitality of her\\npersonality.\\n\\ni introduced myself, and she nodded in quick comprehension.\\n\\n“of course i have often heard of you and your colleague, monsieur\\npoirot. you have done some wonderful things together, haven’t you?\\nit was very clever of my husband to get you so promptly. now will\\nyou ask me questions? that is the easiest way, isn’t it, of getting\\nto know all you want to about this dreadful affair?”\\n\\n“thank you, mrs. havering. now what time was it that this man\\narrived?”\\n\\n“it must have been just before nine o’clock. we had finished\\ndinner, and were sitting over our coffee and cigarettes.”\\n\\n“your husband had already left for london?”\\n\\n“yes, he went up by the 6.15.”\\n\\n“did he go by car to the station, or did he walk?”\\n\\n“our own car isn’t down here. one came out from the garage in\\nelmer’s dale to fetch him in time for the train.”\\n\\n“was mr. pace quite his usual self?”\\n\\n“absolutely. most normal in every way.”\\n\\n“now, can you describe this visitor at all?”\\n\\n“i’m afraid not. i didn’t see him. mrs. middleton showed him\\nstraight into the gun-room and then came to tell my uncle.”\\n\\n“what did your uncle say?”\\n\\n“he seemed rather annoyed, but went off at once. it was about five\\nminutes later that i heard the sound of raised voices. i ran out\\ninto the hall and almost collided with mrs. middleton. then we\\nheard the shot. the gun-room door was locked on the inside, and we\\nhad to go right round the house to the window. of course that took\\nsome time, and the murderer had been able to get well away. my poor\\nuncle”—her voice faltered—“had been shot through the head. i saw\\nat once that he was dead. i sent mrs. middleton for the police. i\\nwas careful to touch nothing in the room but to leave it exactly\\nas i found it.”\\n\\ni nodded approval.\\n\\n“now, as to the weapon?”\\n\\n“well, i can make a guess at it, captain hastings. a pair of\\nrevolvers of my husband’s were mounted upon the wall. one of them\\nis missing. i pointed this out to the police, and they took the\\nother one away with them. when they have extracted the bullet, i\\nsuppose they will know for certain.”\\n\\n“may i go to the gun-room?”\\n\\n“certainly. the police have finished with it. but the body has been\\nremoved.”\\n\\nshe accompanied me to the scene of the crime. at that moment havering\\nentered the hall, and with a quick apology his wife ran to him. i\\nwas left to undertake my investigations alone.\\n\\ni may as well confess at once that they were rather disappointing.\\nin detective novels clues abound, but here i could find nothing\\nthat struck me as out of the ordinary except a large bloodstain on\\nthe carpet where i judged the dead man had fallen. i examined\\neverything with painstaking care and took a couple of pictures of\\nthe room with my little camera which i had brought with me. i also\\nexamined the ground outside the window, but it appeared to have\\nbeen so heavily trampled underfoot that i judged it was useless to\\nwaste time over it. no, i had seen all that hunter’s lodge had to\\nshow me. i must go back to elmer’s dale and get into touch with\\njapp. accordingly i took leave of the haverings, and was driven\\noff in the car that had brought us up from the station.\\n\\ni found japp at the matlock arms and he took me forthwith to see\\nthe body. harrington pace was a small, spare clean-shaven man,\\ntypically american in appearance. he had been shot through the back\\nof the head, and the revolver had been discharged at close quarters.\\n\\n“turned away for a moment,” remarked japp, “and the other fellow\\nsnatched up a revolver and shot him. the one mrs. havering handed\\nover to us was fully loaded and i suppose the other one was also.\\ncurious what darn fool things people do. fancy keeping two loaded\\nrevolvers hanging up on your wall.”\\n\\n“what do you think of the case?” i asked, as we left the gruesome\\nchamber behind us.\\n\\n“well, i’d got my eye on havering to begin with. oh, yes!” noting\\nmy exclamation of astonishment. “havering has one or two shady\\nincidents in his past. when he was a boy at oxford there was some\\nfunny business about the signature on one of his father’s cheques.\\nall hushed up of course. then, he’s pretty heavily in debt now,\\nand they’re the kind of debts he wouldn’t like to go to his uncle\\nabout, whereas you may be sure the uncle’s will would be in his\\nfavour. yes, i’d got my eye on him, and that’s why i wanted to\\nspeak to him before he saw his wife, but their statements dovetail\\nall right, and i’ve been to the station and there’s no doubt\\nwhatever that he left by the 6.15. that gets up to london about\\n10.30. he went straight to his club, he says, and if that’s\\nconfirmed all right—why, he couldn’t have been shooting his uncle\\nhere at nine o’clock in a black beard!”\\n\\n“ah, yes, i was going to ask you what you thought about that\\nbeard?”\\n\\njapp winked.\\n\\n“i think it grew pretty fast—grew in the five miles from elmer’s\\ndale to hunter’s lodge. americans that i’ve met are mostly\\nclean-shaven. yes, it’s amongst mr. pace’s american associates that\\nwe’ll have to look for the murderer. i questioned the housekeeper\\nfirst, and then her mistress, and their stories agree all right,\\nbut i’m sorry mrs. havering didn’t get a look at the fellow. she’s\\na smart woman, and she might have noticed something that would set\\nus on the track.”\\n\\ni sat down and wrote a minute and lengthy account to poirot. i was\\nable to add various further items of information before i posted\\nthe letter.\\n\\nthe bullet had been extracted and was proved to have been fired\\nfrom a revolver identical with the one held by the police.\\nfurthermore, mr. havering’s movements on the night in question had\\nbeen checked and verified, and it was proved beyond doubt that he\\nhad actually arrived in london by the train in question. and,\\nthirdly, a sensational development had occurred. a city gentleman,\\nliving at ealing, on crossing haven green to get to the district\\nrailway station that morning, had observed a brown-paper parcel\\nstuck between the railings. opening it, he found that it contained\\na revolver. he handed the parcel over to the local police station,\\nand before night it was proved to be the one we were in search of,\\nthe fellow to that given us by mrs. havering. one bullet had been\\nfired from it.\\n\\nall this i added to my report. a wire from poirot arrived whilst\\ni was at breakfast the following morning:\\n\\n“of course black bearded man was not havering only you or japp\\nwould have such an idea wire me description of housekeeper and what\\nclothes she wore this morning same of mrs. havering do not waste\\ntime taking photographs of interiors they are underexposed and not\\nin the least artistic.”\\n\\nit seemed to me that poirot’s style was unnecessarily facetious.\\ni also fancied he was a shade jealous of my position on the spot\\nwith full facilities for handling the case. his request for a\\ndescription of the clothes worn by the two women appeared to me to\\nbe simply ridiculous, but i complied as well as i, a mere man, was\\nable to.\\n\\nat eleven a reply wire came from poirot:\\n\\n“advise japp arrest housekeeper before it is too late.”\\n\\ndumbfounded, i took the wire to japp. he swore softly under his\\nbreath.\\n\\n“he’s the goods, monsieur poirot! if he says so, there’s something\\nin it. and i hardly noticed the woman. i don’t know that i can go\\nso far as arresting her, but i’ll have her watched. we’ll go up\\nright away, and take another look at her.”\\n\\nbut it was too late. mrs. middleton, that quiet middle-aged woman,\\nwho had appeared so normal and respectable, had vanished into thin\\nair. her box had been left behind. it contained only ordinary\\nwearing apparel. there was no clue in it to her identity, or as to\\nher whereabouts.\\n\\nfrom mrs. havering we elicited all the facts we could:\\n\\n“i engaged her about three weeks ago when mrs. emery, our former\\nhousekeeper, left. she came to me from mrs. selbourne’s agency in\\nmount street—a very well-known place. i get all my servants from\\nthere. they sent several women to see me, but this mrs. middleton\\nseemed much the nicest, and had splendid references. i engaged her\\non the spot, and notified the agency of the fact. i can’t believe\\nthat there was anything wrong with her. she was such a nice quiet\\nwoman.”\\n\\nthe thing was certainly a mystery. whilst it was clear that the\\nwoman herself could not have committed the crime, since at the\\nmoment the shot was fired mrs. havering was with her in the hall,\\nnevertheless she must have some connection with the murder, or why\\nshould she suddenly take to her heels and bolt?\\n\\ni wired the latest development to poirot and suggested returning\\nto london and making inquiries at selbourne’s agency.\\n\\npoirot’s reply was prompt:\\n\\n“useless to inquire at agency they will never have heard of her\\nfind out what vehicle took her up to hunters lodge when she first\\narrived there.”\\n\\nthough mystified, i was obedient. the means of transport in elmer’s\\ndale were limited. the local garage had two battered ford cars,\\nand there were two station flies. none of these had been\\nrequisitioned on the date in question. questioned, mrs. havering\\nexplained that she had given the woman the money for her fare down\\nto derbyshire and sufficient to hire a car or fly to take her up\\nto hunter’s lodge. there was usually one of the fords at the\\nstation on the chance of its being required. taking into\\nconsideration the further fact that nobody at the station had\\nnoticed the arrival of a stranger, black-bearded or otherwise, on\\nthe fatal evening, everything seemed to point to the conclusion\\nthat the murderer had come to the spot in a car, which had been\\nwaiting near at hand to aid his escape, and that the same car had\\nbrought the mysterious housekeeper to her new post. i may mention\\nthat inquiries at the agency in london bore out poirot’s\\nprognostication. no such woman as “mrs. middleton” had ever been\\non their books. they had received the hon. mrs. havering’s\\napplication for a housekeeper, and had sent her various applicants\\nfor the post. when she sent them the engagement fee, she omitted\\nto mention which woman she had selected.\\n\\nsomewhat crestfallen, i returned to london. i found poirot\\nestablished in an arm-chair by the fire in a garish, silk\\ndressing-gown. he greeted me with much affection.\\n\\n“_mon ami_ hastings! but how glad i am to see you. veritably i have\\nfor you a great affection. and you have enjoyed yourself? you have\\nrun to and fro with the good japp? you have interrogated and\\ninvestigated to your heart’s content?”\\n\\n“poirot,” i cried, “the thing’s a dark mystery! it will never be\\nsolved.”\\n\\n“it is true that we are not likely to cover ourselves with glory\\nover it.”\\n\\n“no, indeed. it’s a hard nut to crack.”\\n\\n“oh, as far as that goes, i am very good at cracking the nuts! a\\nveritable squirrel! it is not that which embarrasses me. i know\\nwell enough who killed mr. harrington pace.”\\n\\n“you know? how did you find out?”\\n\\n“your illuminating answers to my wires supplied me with the truth.\\nsee here, hastings, let us examine the facts methodically and in\\norder. mr. harrington pace is a man with a considerable fortune\\nwhich at his death will doubtless pass to his nephew. point no. 1.\\nhis nephew is known to be desperately hard up. point no. 2. his\\nnephew is also known to be—shall we say a man of rather loose\\nmoral fibre? point no. 3.”\\n\\n“but roger havering is proved to have journeyed straight up to\\nlondon.”\\n\\n“_précisément_—and therefore, as mr. havering left elmer’s dale at\\n6.15, and since mr. pace cannot have been killed before he left,\\nor the doctor would have spotted the time of the crime as being\\ngiven wrongly when he examined the body, we conclude quite rightly,\\nthat mr. havering did not shoot his uncle. but there is a mrs.\\nhavering, hastings.”\\n\\n“impossible! the housekeeper was with her when the shot was fired.”\\n\\n“ah, yes, the housekeeper. but she has disappeared.”\\n\\n“she will be found.”\\n\\n“i think not. there is something peculiarly elusive about that\\nhousekeeper, don’t you think so, hastings? it struck me at once.”\\n\\n“she played her part, i suppose, and then got out in the nick of\\ntime.”\\n\\n“and what was her part?”\\n\\n“well, presumably to admit her confederate, the black-bearded man.”\\n\\n“oh, no, that was not her part! her part was what you have just\\nmentioned, to provide an alibi for mrs. havering at the moment the\\nshot was fired. and no one will ever find her, _mon ami_, because\\nshe does not exist! ‘there’s no sech person,’ as your so great\\nshakespeare says.”\\n\\n“it was dickens,” i murmured, unable to suppress a smile. “but what\\ndo you mean, poirot?”\\n\\n“i mean that zoe havering was an actress before her marriage, that\\nyou and japp only saw the housekeeper in a dark hall, a dim\\nmiddle-aged figure in black with a faint subdued voice, and finally\\nthat neither you nor japp, nor the local police whom the housekeeper\\nfetched, ever saw mrs. middleton and her mistress at one and the\\nsame time. it was child’s play for that clever and daring woman.\\non the pretext of summoning her mistress, she runs upstairs, slips\\non a bright jumper and a hat with black curls attached which she\\njams down over the grey transformation. a few deft touches, and\\nthe make-up is removed, a slight dusting of rouge, and the brilliant\\nzoe havering comes down with her clear ringing voice. nobody looks\\nparticularly at the housekeeper. why should they? there is nothing\\nto connect her with the crime. she, too, has an alibi.”\\n\\n“but the revolver that was found at ealing? mrs. havering could\\nnot have placed it there?”\\n\\n“no, that was roger havering’s job—but it was a mistake on their\\npart. it put me on the right track. a man who has committed a\\nmurder with a revolver which he found on the spot would fling it\\naway at once, he would not carry it up to london with him. no, the\\nmotive was clear, the criminals wished to focus the interest of\\nthe police on a spot far removed from derbyshire they were anxious\\nto get the police away as soon as possible from the vicinity of\\nhunter’s lodge. of course the revolver found at ealing was not the\\none with which mr. pace was shot. roger havering discharged one\\nshot from it, brought it up to london, went straight to his club\\nto establish his alibi, then went quickly out to ealing by the\\ndistrict, a matter of about twenty minutes only, placed the parcel\\nwhere it was found and so back to town. that charming creature,\\nhis wife, quietly shoots mr. pace after dinner—you remember he was\\nshot from behind? another significant point, that!—reloads the\\nrevolver and puts it back in its place, and then starts off with\\nher desperate little comedy.”\\n\\n“it’s incredible,” i murmured, fascinated, “and yet——”\\n\\n“and yet it is true. _bien sur_, my friend, it is true. but to\\nbring that precious pair to justice, that is another matter. well,\\njapp must do what he can—i have written him fully—but i very much\\nfear, hastings, that we shall be obliged to leave them to fate, or\\n_le bon dieu_, whichever you prefer.”\\n\\n“the wicked flourish like a green bay tree,” i reminded him.\\n\\n“but at a price, hastings, always at a price, _croyez-moi!_”\\n\\npoirot’s forebodings were confirmed. japp, though convinced of the\\ntruth of his theory, was unable to get together the necessary\\nevidence to ensure a conviction.\\n\\nmr. pace’s huge fortune passed into the hands of his murderers.\\nnevertheless, nemesis did overtake them, and when i read in the\\npaper that the hon. roger and mrs. havering were amongst those\\nkilled in the crashing of the air mail to paris i knew that justice\\nwas satisfied.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  v\\n\\n  the million dollar bond robbery\\n\\n“what a number of bond robberies there have been lately!” i observed\\none morning, laying aside the newspaper. “poirot, let us forsake\\nthe science of detection, and take to crime instead!”\\n\\n“you are on the—how do you say it?—get-rich-quick tack, eh, _mon\\nami_?”\\n\\n“well, look at this last _coup_, the million dollars’ worth of\\nliberty bonds which the london and scottish bank were sending to\\nnew york, and which disappeared in such a remarkable manner on\\nboard the _olympia_.”\\n\\n“if it were not for the _mal de mer_, and the difficulty of\\npractising the so excellent method of laverguier for a longer time\\nthan the few hours of crossing the channel, i should delight to\\nvoyage myself on one of these big liners,” murmured poirot dreamily.\\n\\n“yes, indeed,” i said enthusiastically. “some of them must be\\nperfect palaces; the swimming-baths, the lounges, the restaurant,\\nthe palm courts—really, it must be hard to believe that one is on\\nthe sea.”\\n\\n“me, i always know when i am on the sea,” said poirot sadly. “and\\nall those bagatelles that you enumerate, they say nothing to me;\\nbut, my friend, consider for a moment the geniuses that travel as\\nit were incognito! on board these floating palaces, as you so\\njustly call them, one would meet the élite, the _haute noblesse_\\nof the criminal world!”\\n\\ni laughed.\\n\\n“so that’s the way your enthusiasm runs! you would have liked to\\ncross swords with the man who sneaked the liberty bonds?”\\n\\nthe landlady interrupted us.\\n\\n“a young lady as wants to see you, mr. poirot. here’s her card.”\\n\\nthe card bore the inscription: miss esmée farquhar, and poirot,\\nafter diving under the table to retrieve a stray crumb, and putting\\nit carefully in the waste-paper-basket, nodded to the landlady to\\nadmit her.\\n\\nin another minute one of the most charming girls i have ever seen\\nwas ushered into the room. she was perhaps about five-and-twenty,\\nwith big brown eyes and a perfect figure. she was well-dressed and\\nperfectly composed in manner.\\n\\n“sit down, i beg of you, mademoiselle. this is my friend, captain\\nhastings, who aids me in my little problems.”\\n\\n“i am afraid it is a big problem i have brought you to-day, monsieur\\npoirot,” said the girl, giving me a pleasant bow as she seated\\nherself. “i dare say you have read about it in the papers. i am\\nreferring to the theft of liberty bonds on the _olympia_.” some\\nastonishment must have shown itself in poirot’s face, for she\\ncontinued quickly: “you are doubtless asking yourself what i have\\nto do with a grave institution like the london and scottish bank.\\nin one sense nothing, in another sense everything. you see, monsieur\\npoirot, i am engaged to mr. philip ridgeway.”\\n\\n“aha! and mr. philip ridgeway——”\\n\\n“was in charge of the bonds when they were stolen. of course no\\nactual blame can attach to him, it was not his fault in any way.\\nnevertheless, he is half distraught over the matter, and his uncle,\\ni know, insists that he must carelessly have mentioned having them\\nin his possession. it is a terrible set-back in his career.”\\n\\n“who is his uncle?”\\n\\n“mr. vavasour, joint general manager of the london and scottish\\nbank.”\\n\\n“suppose, miss farquhar, that you recount to me the whole story?”\\n\\n“very well. as you know, the bank wished to extend their credits\\nin america, and for this purpose decided to send over a million\\ndollars in liberty bonds. mr. vavasour selected his nephew, who\\nhad occupied a position of trust in the bank for many years and\\nwho was conversant with all the details of the bank’s dealings in\\nnew york, to make the trip. the olympia sailed from liverpool on\\nthe 23rd, and the bonds were handed over to philip on the morning\\nof that day by mr. vavasour and mr. shaw, the two joint general\\nmanagers of the london and scottish bank. they were counted,\\nenclosed in a package, and sealed in his presence, and he then\\nlocked the package at once in his portmanteau.”\\n\\n“a portmanteau with an ordinary lock?”\\n\\n“no, mr. shaw insisted on a special lock being fitted to it by\\nhubbs’s. philip, as i say, placed the package at the bottom of the\\ntrunk. it was stolen just a few hours before reaching new york. a\\nrigorous search of the whole ship was made, but without result.\\nthe bonds seemed literally to have vanished into thin air.”\\n\\npoirot made a grimace.\\n\\n“but they did not vanish absolutely, since i gather that they were\\nsold in small parcels within half an hour of the docking of the\\n_olympia_! well, undoubtedly the next thing is for me to see mr.\\nridgeway.”\\n\\n“i was about to suggest that you should lunch with me at the\\n‘cheshire cheese.’ philip will be there. he is meeting me, but does\\nnot yet know that i have been consulting you on his behalf.”\\n\\nwe agreed to this suggestion readily enough, and drove there in a\\ntaxi.\\n\\nmr. philip ridgeway was there before us, and looked somewhat\\nsurprised to see his fiancée arriving with two complete strangers.\\nhe was a nice-looking young fellow, tall and spruce, with a touch\\nof greying hair at the temples, though he could not have been much\\nover thirty.\\n\\nmiss farquhar went up to him and laid her hand on his arm.\\n\\n“you must forgive my acting without consulting you, philip,” she\\nsaid. “let me introduce you to monsieur hercule poirot, of whom\\nyou must often have heard, and his friend, captain hastings.”\\n\\nridgeway looked very astonished.\\n\\n“of course i have heard of you, monsieur poirot,” he said, as he\\nshook hands. “but i had no idea that esmée was thinking of\\nconsulting you about my—our trouble.”\\n\\n“i was afraid you would not let me do it, philip,” said miss\\nfarquhar meekly.\\n\\n“so you took care to be on the safe side,” he observed, with a\\nsmile. “i hope monsieur poirot will be able to throw some light on\\nthis extraordinary puzzle, for i confess frankly that i am nearly\\nout of my mind with worry and anxiety about it.”\\n\\nindeed, his face looked drawn and haggard and showed only too\\nclearly the strain under which he was labouring.\\n\\n“well, well,” said poirot. “let us lunch, and over lunch we will\\nput our heads together and see what can be done. i want to hear\\nmr. ridgeway’s story from his own lips.”\\n\\nwhilst we discussed the excellent steak and kidney pudding of the\\nestablishment, philip ridgeway narrated the circumstances leading\\nto the disappearance of the bonds. his story agreed with that of\\nmiss farquhar in every particular. when he had finished, poirot\\ntook up the thread with a question.\\n\\n“what exactly led you to discover that the bonds had been stolen,\\nmr. ridgeway?”\\n\\nhe laughed rather bitterly.\\n\\n“the thing stared me in the face, monsieur poirot. i couldn’t have\\nmissed it. my cabin trunk was half out from under the bunk and all\\nscratched and cut about where they’d tried to force the lock.”\\n\\n“but i understood that it had been opened with a key?”\\n\\n“that’s so. they tried to force it, but couldn’t. and, in the end,\\nthey must have got it unlocked somehow or other.”\\n\\n“curious,” said poirot, his eyes beginning to flicker with the\\ngreen light i knew so well. “very curious! they waste much, much\\ntime trying to prise it open, and then—_sapristi!_ they find that\\nthey have the key all the time—for each of hubbs’s locks are\\nunique.”\\n\\n“that’s just why they couldn’t have had the key. it never left me\\nday or night.”\\n\\n“you are sure of that?”\\n\\n“i can swear to it, and besides, if they had had the key or a\\nduplicate, why should they waste time trying to force an obviously\\nunforceable lock?”\\n\\n“ah! there is exactly the question we are asking ourselves! i\\nventure to prophesy that the solution, if we ever find it, will\\nhinge on that curious fact. i beg of you not to assault me if i\\nask you one more question: _are you perfectly certain you did not\\nleave the trunk unlocked?_”\\n\\nphilip ridgeway merely looked at him, and poirot gesticulated\\napologetically.\\n\\n“ah, but these things can happen, i assure you! very well, the\\nbonds were stolen from the trunk. what did the thief do with them?\\nhow did he manage to get ashore with them?”\\n\\n“ah!” cried ridgeway. “that’s just it. how? word was passed to the\\ncustoms authorities, and every soul that left the ship was gone\\nover with a toothcomb!”\\n\\n“and the bonds, i gather, made a bulky package?”\\n\\n“certainly they did. they could hardly have been hidden on board—and\\nanyway we know they weren’t because they were offered for sale\\nwithin half an hour of the _olympia’s_ arrival, long before i got\\nthe cables going and the numbers sent out. one broker swears he\\nbought some of them even before the _olympia_ got in. but you can’t\\nsend bonds by wireless.”\\n\\n“not by wireless, but did any tug come alongside?”\\n\\n“only the official ones, and that was after the alarm was given\\nwhen every one was on the look-out. i was watching out myself for\\ntheir being passed over to some one that way. my god, monsieur\\npoirot, this thing will drive me mad! people are beginning to say\\ni stole them myself.”\\n\\n“but you also were searched on landing, weren’t you?” asked poirot\\ngently.\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\nthe young man stared at him in a puzzled manner.\\n\\n“you do not catch my meaning, i see,” said poirot, smiling\\nenigmatically. “now i should like to make a few inquiries at the\\nbank.”\\n\\nridgeway produced a card and scribbled a few words on it.\\n\\n“send this in and my uncle will see you at once.”\\n\\npoirot thanked him, bade farewell to miss farquhar, and together\\nwe started out for threadneedle street and the head office of the\\nlondon and scottish bank. on production of ridgeway’s card, we were\\nled through the labyrinth of counters and desks, skirting paying-in\\nclerks and paying-out clerks and up to a small office on the first\\nfloor where the joint general managers received us. they were two\\ngrave gentlemen, who had grown grey in the service of the bank.\\nmr. vavasour had a short white beard, mr. shaw was clean shaven.\\n\\n“i understand you are strictly a private inquiry agent?” said mr.\\nvavasour. “quite so, quite so. we have, of course, placed ourselves\\nin the hands of scotland yard. inspector mcneil has charge of the\\ncase. a very able officer, i believe.”\\n\\n“i am sure of it,” said poirot politely. “you will permit a few\\nquestions, on your nephew’s behalf? about this lock, who ordered\\nit from hubbs’s?”\\n\\n“i ordered it myself,” said mr. shaw. “i would not trust to any\\nclerk in the matter. as to the keys, mr. ridgeway had one, and the\\nother two are held by my colleague and myself.”\\n\\n“and no clerk has had access to them?”\\n\\nmr. shaw turned inquiringly to mr. vavasour. “i think i am correct\\nin saying that they have remained in the safe where we placed them\\non the 23rd,” said mr. vavasour. “my colleague was unfortunately\\ntaken ill a fortnight ago—in fact on the very day that philip left\\nus. he has only just recovered.”\\n\\n“severe bronchitis is no joke to a man of my age,” said mr. shaw\\nruefully. “but i am afraid mr. vavasour has suffered from the hard\\nwork entailed by my absence, especially with this unexpected worry\\ncoming on top of everything.”\\n\\npoirot asked a few more questions. i judged that he was endeavouring\\nto gauge the exact amount of intimacy between uncle and nephew.\\nmr. vavasour’s answers were brief and punctilious. his nephew was\\na trusted official of the bank, and had no debts or money\\ndifficulties that he knew of. he had been entrusted with similar\\nmissions in the past. finally we were politely bowed out.\\n\\n“i am disappointed,” said poirot, as we emerged into the street.\\n\\n“you hoped to discover more? they are such stodgy old men.”\\n\\n“it is not their stodginess which disappoints me, _mon ami_. i do\\nnot expect to find in a bank manager a ‘keen financier with an\\neagle glance’ as your favourite works of fiction put it. no, i am\\ndisappointed in the case—it is too easy!”\\n\\n“easy?”\\n\\n“yes, do you not find it almost childishly simple?”\\n\\n“you know who stole the bonds?”\\n\\n“i do.”\\n\\n“but then—we must—why——”\\n\\n“do not confuse and fluster yourself, hastings. we are not going\\nto do anything at present.”\\n\\n“but why? what are you waiting for?”\\n\\n“for the _olympia_. she is due on her return trip from new york on\\ntuesday.”\\n\\n“but if you know who stole the bonds, why wait? he may escape.”\\n\\n“to a south sea island where there is no extradition? no, _mon\\nami_, he would find life very uncongenial there. as to why i\\nwait—_eh bien_ to the intelligence of hercule poirot the case is\\nperfectly clear, but for the benefit of others, not so greatly\\ngifted by the good god—the inspector mcneil, for instance—it would\\nbe as well to make a few inquiries to establish the facts. one must\\nhave consideration for those less gifted than oneself.”\\n\\n“good lord, poirot! do you know, i’d give a considerable sum of\\nmoney to see you make a thorough ass of yourself—just for once.\\nyou’re so confoundedly conceited!”\\n\\n“do not enrage yourself, hastings. in verity, i observe that there\\nare times when you almost detest me! alas, i suffer the penalties\\nof greatness!”\\n\\nthe little man puffed out his chest, and sighed so comically that\\ni was forced to laugh.\\n\\ntuesday saw us speeding to liverpool in a first-class carriage of\\nthe l. & n.w.r. poirot had obstinately refused to enlighten me as\\nto his suspicions—or certainties. he contented himself with\\nexpressing surprise that i, too, was not equally _au fait_ with\\nthe situation. i disdained to argue, and entrenched my curiosity\\nbehind a rampart of pretended indifference.\\n\\nonce arrived at the quay alongside which lay the big transatlantic\\nliner, poirot became brisk and alert. our proceedings consisted in\\ninterviewing four successive stewards and inquiring after a friend\\nof poirot’s who had crossed to new york on the 23rd.\\n\\n“an elderly gentleman, wearing glasses. a great invalid, hardly\\nmoved out of his cabin.”\\n\\nthe description appeared to tally with one mr. ventnor who had\\noccupied the cabin c 24 which was next to that of philip ridgeway.\\nalthough unable to see how poirot had deduced mr. ventnor’s\\nexistence and personal appearance, i was keenly excited.\\n\\n“tell me,” i cried, “was this gentleman one of the first to land\\nwhen you got to new york?” the steward shook his head.\\n\\n“no, indeed, sir, he was one of the last off the boat.”\\n\\ni retired crestfallen, and observed poirot grinning at me. he\\nthanked the steward, a note changed hands, and we took our\\ndeparture.\\n\\n“it’s all very well,” i remarked heatedly, “but that last answer\\nmust have damped your precious theory, grin as you please!”\\n\\n“as usual, you see nothing, hastings. that last answer is, on the\\ncontrary, the coping-stone of my theory.”\\n\\ni flung up my hands in despair.\\n\\n“i give it up.”\\n\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\n\\nwhen we were in the train, speeding towards london, poirot wrote\\nbusily for a few minutes, sealing up the result in an envelope.\\n\\n“this is for the good inspector mcneil. we will leave it at scotland\\nyard in passing, and then to the rendezvous restaurant, where i\\nhave asked miss esmée farquhar to do us the honour of dining with\\nus.”\\n\\n“what about ridgeway?”\\n\\n“what about him?” asked poirot with a twinkle.\\n\\n“why, you surely don’t think—you can’t——”\\n\\n“the habit of incoherence is growing upon you, hastings. as a\\nmatter of fact i _did_ think. if ridgeway had been the thief—which\\nwas perfectly possible—the case would have been charming; a piece\\nof neat methodical work.”\\n\\n“but not so charming for miss farquhar.”\\n\\n“possibly you are right. therefore all is for the best. now,\\nhastings, let us review the case. i can see that you are dying to\\ndo so. the sealed package is removed from the trunk and vanishes,\\nas miss farquhar puts it, into thin air. we will dismiss the thin\\nair theory, which is not practicable at the present stage of\\nscience, and consider what is likely to have become of it. every\\none asserts the incredibility of its being smuggled ashore——”\\n\\n“yes, but we know——”\\n\\n“_you_ may know, hastings. i do not. i take the view that, since\\nit seemed incredible, it _was_ incredible. two possibilities\\nremain: it was hidden on board—also rather difficult—or it was\\nthrown overboard.”\\n\\n“with a cork on it, do you mean?”\\n\\n“without a cork.”\\n\\ni stared.\\n\\n“but if the bonds were thrown overboard, they couldn’t have been\\nsold in new york.”\\n\\n“i admire your logical mind, hastings. the bonds were sold in new\\nyork, therefore they were not thrown overboard. you see where that\\nleads us?”\\n\\n“where we were when we started.”\\n\\n“_jamais de la vie!_ if the package was thrown overboard, and the\\nbonds were sold in new york, the package could not have contained\\nthe bonds. is there any evidence that the package _did_ contain\\nthe bonds? remember, mr. ridgeway never opened it from the time it\\nwas placed in his hands in london.”\\n\\n“yes, but then——”\\n\\npoirot waved an impatient hand.\\n\\n“permit me to continue. the last moment that the bonds are seen as\\nbonds is in the office of the london and scottish bank on the\\nmorning of the 23rd. they reappear in new york half an hour after\\nthe _olympia_ gets in, and according to one man, whom nobody\\nlistens to, actually _before_ she gets in. supposing then, that\\nthey have never been on the _olympia_ at all? is there any other\\nway they could get to new york? yes. the _gigantic_ leaves\\nsouthampton on the same day as the _olympia_, and she holds the\\nrecord for the atlantic. mailed by the _gigantic_, the bonds would\\nbe in new york the day before the _olympia_ arrived. all is clear,\\nthe case begins to explain itself. the sealed packet is only a\\ndummy, and the moment of its substitution must be in the office in\\nthe bank. it would be an easy matter for any of the three men\\npresent to have prepared a duplicate package which could be\\nsubstituted for the genuine one. _très bien_, the bonds are mailed\\nto a confederate in new york, with instructions to sell as soon as\\nthe _olympia_ is in, but some one must travel on the _olympia_ to\\nengineer the supposed moment of the robbery.”\\n\\n“but why?”\\n\\n“because if ridgeway merely opens the packet and finds it a dummy,\\nsuspicion flies at once to london. no, the man on board in the\\ncabin next door does his work, pretends to force the lock in an\\nobvious manner so as to draw immediate attention to the theft,\\nreally unlocks the trunk with a duplicate key, throws the package\\noverboard and waits until the last to leave the boat. naturally he\\nwears glasses to conceal his eyes, and is an invalid since he does\\nnot want to run the risk of meeting ridgeway. he steps ashore in\\nnew york and returns by the first boat available.”\\n\\n“but who—which was he?”\\n\\n“the man who had a duplicate key, the man who ordered the lock,\\nthe man who has _not_ been severely ill with bronchitis at his home\\nin the country—_enfin_, that ‘stodgy’ old man, mr. shaw! there are\\ncriminals in high places sometimes, my friend. ah, here we are.\\nmademoiselle, i have succeeded! you permit?”\\n\\nand, beaming, poirot kissed the astonished girl lightly on either\\ncheek!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  vi\\n\\n\\n  the adventure of the egyptian tomb\\n\\n\\ni have always considered that one of the most thrilling and dramatic\\nof the many adventures i have shared with poirot was that of our\\ninvestigation into the strange series of deaths which followed upon\\nthe discovery and opening of the tomb of king men-her-ra.\\n\\nhard upon the discovery of the tomb of tut-ankh-amen by lord\\ncarnarvon, sir john willard and mr. bleibner of new york, pursuing\\ntheir excavations not far from cairo, in the vicinity of the\\npyramids of gizeh, came unexpectedly on a series of funeral\\nchambers. the greatest interest was aroused by their discovery.\\nthe tomb appeared to be that of king men-her-ra, one of those\\nshadowy kings of the eighth dynasty, when the old kingdom was\\nfalling to decay. little was known about this period, and the\\ndiscoveries were fully reported in the newspapers.\\n\\nan event soon occurred which took a profound hold on the public\\nmind. sir john willard died quite suddenly of heart failure.\\n\\nthe more sensational newspapers immediately took the opportunity\\nof reviving all the old superstitious stories connected with the\\nill luck of certain egyptian treasures. the unlucky mummy at the\\nbritish museum, that hoary old chestnut, was dragged out with fresh\\nzest, was quietly denied by the museum, but nevertheless enjoyed\\nall its usual vogue.\\n\\na fortnight later mr. bleibner died of acute blood poisoning, and\\na few days afterwards a nephew of his shot himself in new york.\\nthe “curse of men-her-ra” was the talk of the day, and the magic\\npower of dead and gone egypt was exalted to a fetish point.\\n\\nit was then that poirot received a brief note from lady willard,\\nwidow of the dead archaeologist, asking him to go and see her at\\nher house in kensington square. i accompanied him.\\n\\nlady willard was a tall, thin woman, dressed in deep mourning. her\\nhaggard face bore eloquent testimony to her recent grief.\\n\\n“it is kind of you to have come so promptly, monsieur poirot.”\\n\\n“i am at your service, lady willard. you wished to consult me?”\\n\\n“you are, i am aware, a detective, but it is not only as a detective\\nthat i wish to consult you. you are a man of original views, i\\nknow, you have imagination, experience of the world, tell me,\\nmonsieur poirot, what are your views on the supernatural?”\\n\\npoirot hesitated for a moment before he replied. he seemed to be\\nconsidering. finally he said:\\n\\n“let us not misunderstand each other, lady willard. it is not a\\ngeneral question that you are asking me there. it has a personal\\napplication, has it not? you are referring obliquely to the death\\nof your late husband?”\\n\\n“that is so,” she admitted.\\n\\n“you want me to investigate the circumstances of his death?”\\n\\n“i want you to ascertain for me exactly how much is newspaper\\nchatter, and how much may be said to be founded on fact? three\\ndeaths, monsieur poirot—each one explicable taken by itself, but\\ntaken together surely an almost unbelievable coincidence, and all\\nwithin a month of the opening of the tomb! it may be mere\\nsuperstition, it may be some potent curse from the past that\\noperates in ways undreamed of by modern science. the fact\\nremains—three deaths! and i am afraid, monsieur poirot, horribly\\nafraid. it may not yet be the end.”\\n\\n“for whom do you fear?”\\n\\n“for my son. when the news of my husband’s death came i was ill.\\nmy son, who has just come down from oxford, went out there. he\\nbrought the—the body home, but now he has gone out again, in spite\\nof my prayers and entreaties. he is so fascinated by the work that\\nhe intends to take his father’s place and carry on the system of\\nexcavations. you may think me a foolish, credulous woman, but,\\nmonsieur poirot, i am afraid. supposing that the spirit of the dead\\nking is not yet appeased? perhaps to you i seem to be talking\\nnonsense——”\\n\\n“no, indeed, lady willard,” said poirot quickly. “i, too, believe\\nin the force of superstition, one of the greatest forces the world\\nhas ever known.”\\n\\ni looked at him in surprise. i should never have credited poirot\\nwith being superstitious. but the little man was obviously in\\nearnest.\\n\\n“what you really demand is that i shall protect your son? i will\\ndo my utmost to keep him from harm.”\\n\\n“yes, in the ordinary way, but against an occult influence?”\\n\\n“in volumes of the middle ages, lady willard, you will find many\\nways of counteracting black magic. perhaps they knew more than we\\nmoderns with all our boasted science. now let us come to facts,\\nthat i may have guidance. your husband had always been a devoted\\negyptologist, hadn’t he?”\\n\\n“yes, from his youth upwards. he was one of the greatest living\\nauthorities upon the subject.”\\n\\n“but mr. bleibner, i understand, was more or less of an amateur?”\\n\\n“oh, quite. he was a very wealthy man who dabbled freely in any\\nsubject that happened to take his fancy. my husband managed to\\ninterest him in egyptology, and it was his money that was so useful\\nin financing the expedition.”\\n\\n“and the nephew? what do you know of his tastes? was he with the\\nparty at all?”\\n\\n“i do not think so. in fact i never knew of his existence till i\\nread of his death in the paper, i do not think he and mr. bleibner\\ncan have been at all intimate. he never spoke of having any\\nrelations.”\\n\\n“who are the other members of the party?”\\n\\n“well, there is dr. tosswill, a minor official connected with the\\nbritish museum; mr. schneider of the metropolitan museum in new\\nyork; a young american secretary; dr. ames, who accompanies the\\nexpedition in his professional capacity; and hassan, my husband’s\\ndevoted native servant.”\\n\\n“do you remember the name of the american secretary?”\\n\\n“harper, i think, but i cannot be sure. he had not been with mr.\\nbleibner very long, i know. he was a very pleasant young fellow.”\\n\\n“thank you, lady willard.”\\n\\n“if there is anything else——?”\\n\\n“for the moment, nothing. leave it now in my hands, and be assured\\nthat i will do all that is humanly possible to protect your son.”\\n\\nthey were not exactly reassuring words, and i observed lady willard\\nwince as he uttered them. yet, at the same time, the fact that he\\nhad not pooh-poohed her fears seemed in itself to be a relief to\\nher.\\n\\nfor my part i had never before suspected that poirot had so deep\\na vein of superstition in his nature. i tackled him on the subject\\nas we went homewards. his manner was grave and earnest.\\n\\n“but yes, hastings. i believe in these things. you must not\\nunderrate the force of superstition.”\\n\\n“what are we going to do about it?”\\n\\n“_toujours pratique_, the good hastings! _eh bien_, to begin with\\nwe are going to cable to new york for fuller details of young mr.\\nbleibner’s death.”\\n\\nhe duly sent off his cable. the reply was full and precise. young\\nrupert bleibner had been in low water for several years. he had\\nbeen a beach-comber and a remittance man in several south sea\\nislands, but had returned to new york two years ago, where he had\\nrapidly sunk lower and lower. the most significant thing, to my\\nmind, was that he had recently managed to borrow enough money to\\ntake him to egypt. “i’ve a good friend there i can borrow from,”\\nhe had declared. here, however, his plans had gone awry. he had\\nreturned to new york cursing his skinflint of an uncle who cared\\nmore for the bones of dead and gone kings than his own flesh and\\nblood. it was during his sojourn in egypt that the death of sir\\njohn willard occurred. rupert had plunged once more into his life\\nof dissipation in new york, and then, without warning, he had\\ncommitted suicide, leaving behind him a letter which contained some\\ncurious phrases. it seemed written in a sudden fit of remorse. he\\nreferred to himself as a leper and an outcast, and the letter ended\\nby declaring that such as he were better dead.\\n\\na shadowy theory leapt into my brain. i had never really believed\\nin the vengeance of a long dead egyptian king. i saw here a more\\nmodern crime. supposing this young man had decided to do away with\\nhis uncle—preferably by poison. by mistake, sir john willard\\nreceives the fatal dose. the young man returns to new york, haunted\\nby his crime. the news of his uncle’s death reaches him. he realizes\\nhow unnecessary his crime has been, and stricken with remorse takes\\nhis own life.\\n\\ni outlined my solution to poirot. he was interested.\\n\\n“it is ingenious what you have thought of there—decidedly it is\\ningenious. it may even be true. but you leave out of count the\\nfatal influence of the tomb.”\\n\\ni shrugged my shoulders.\\n\\n“you still think that has something to do with it?”\\n\\n“so much so, _mon ami_, that we start for egypt to-morrow.”\\n\\n“what?” i cried, astonished.\\n\\n“i have said it.” an expression of conscious heroism spread over\\npoirot’s face. then he groaned. “but, oh,” he lamented, “the sea!\\nthe hateful sea!”\\n\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\n\\nit was a week later. beneath our feet was the golden sand of the\\ndesert. the hot sun poured down overhead. poirot, the picture of\\nmisery, wilted by my side. the little man was not a good traveller.\\nour four days’ voyage from marseilles had been one long agony to\\nhim. he had landed at alexandria the wraith of his former self,\\neven his usual neatness had deserted him. we had arrived in cairo\\nand had driven out at once to the mena house hotel, right in the\\nshadow of the pyramids.\\n\\nthe charm of egypt had laid hold of me. not so poirot. dressed\\nprecisely the same as in london, he carried a small clothes-brush\\nin his pocket and waged an unceasing war on the dust which\\naccumulated on his dark apparel.\\n\\n“and my boots,” he wailed. “regard them, hastings. my boots, of\\nthe neat patent leather, usually so smart and shining. see, the\\nsand is inside them, which is painful, and outside them, which\\noutrages the eyesight. also the heat, it causes my moustaches to\\nbecome limp—but limp!”\\n\\n“look at the sphinx,” i urged. “even i can feel the mystery and\\nthe charm it exhales.”\\n\\npoirot looked at it discontentedly.\\n\\n“it has not the air happy,” he declared. “how could it, half-buried\\nin sand in that untidy fashion. ah, this cursed sand!”\\n\\n“come, now, there’s a lot of sand in belgium,” i reminded him,\\nmindful of a holiday spent at knocke-sur-mer in the midst of “_les\\ndunes impeccables_” as the guide-book had phrased it.\\n\\n“not in brussels,” declared poirot. he gazed at the pyramids\\nthoughtfully. “it is true that they, at least, are of a shape solid\\nand geometrical, but their surface is of an unevenness most\\nunpleasing. and the palm-trees i like them not. not even do they\\nplant them in rows!”\\n\\ni cut short his lamentations, by suggesting that we should start\\nfor the camp. we were to ride there on camels, and the beasts were\\npatiently kneeling, waiting for us to mount, in charge of several\\npicturesque boys headed by a voluble dragoman.\\n\\ni pass over the spectacle of poirot on a camel. he started by\\ngroans and lamentations and ended by shrieks, gesticulations and\\ninvocations to the virgin mary and every saint in the calendar. in\\nthe end, he descended ignominiously and finished the journey on a\\ndiminutive donkey. i must admit that a trotting camel is no joke\\nfor the amateur. i was stiff for several days.\\n\\nat last we neared the scene of the excavations. a sunburnt man with\\na grey beard, in white clothes and wearing a helmet, came to meet\\nus.\\n\\n“monsieur poirot and captain hastings? we received your cable. i’m\\nsorry that there was no one to meet you in cairo. an unforeseen\\nevent occurred which completely disorganized our plans.”\\n\\npoirot paled. his hand, which had stolen to his clothes-brush,\\nstayed its course.\\n\\n“not another death?” he breathed.\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“sir guy willard?” i cried.\\n\\n“no, captain hastings. my american colleague, mr. schneider.”\\n\\n“and the cause?” demanded poirot.\\n\\n“tetanus.”\\n\\ni blanched. all around me i seemed to feel an atmosphere of evil,\\nsubtle and menacing. a horrible thought flashed across me. supposing\\ni were the next?\\n\\n“_mon dieu_,” said poirot, in a very low voice, “i do not understand\\nthis. it is horrible. tell me, monsieur, there is no doubt that it\\nwas tetanus?”\\n\\n“i believe not. but dr. ames will tell you more than i can do.”\\n\\n“ah, of course, you are not the doctor.”\\n\\n“my name is tosswill.”\\n\\nthis, then, was the british expert described by lady willard as\\nbeing a minor official at the british museum. there was something\\nat once grave and steadfast about him that took my fancy.\\n\\n“if you will come with me,” continued dr. tosswill, “i will take\\nyou to sir guy willard. he was most anxious to be informed as soon\\nas you should arrive.”\\n\\nwe were taken across the camp to a large tent. dr. tosswill lifted\\nup the flap and we entered. three men were sitting inside.\\n\\n“monsieur poirot and captain hastings have arrived, sir guy,” said\\ntosswill.\\n\\nthe youngest of the three men jumped up and came forward to greet\\nus. there was a certain impulsiveness in his manner which reminded\\nme of his mother. he was not nearly so sunburnt as the others, and\\nthat fact, coupled with a certain haggardness round the eyes, made\\nhim look older than his twenty-two years. he was clearly endeavouring\\nto bear up under a severe mental strain.\\n\\nhe introduced his two companions, dr. ames, a capable looking man\\nof thirty odd, with a touch of greying hair at the temples, and\\nmr. harper, the secretary, a pleasant lean young man wearing the\\nnational insignia of horn-rimmed spectacles.\\n\\nafter a few minutes’ desultory conversation the latter went out,\\nand dr. tosswill followed him. we were left alone with sir guy and\\ndr. ames.\\n\\n“please ask any questions you want to ask, monsieur poirot,” said\\nwillard. “we are utterly dumbfounded at this strange series of\\ndisasters, but it isn’t—it can’t be, anything but coincidence.”\\n\\nthere was a nervousness about his manner which rather belied the\\nwords. i saw that poirot was studying him keenly.\\n\\n“your heart is really in this work, sir guy?”\\n\\n“rather. no matter what happens, or what comes of it, the work is\\ngoing on. make up your mind to that.”\\n\\npoirot wheeled round on the other.\\n\\n“what have you to say to that, _monsieur le docteur_?”\\n\\n“well,” drawled the doctor, “i’m not for quitting myself.”\\n\\npoirot made one of those expressive grimaces of his.\\n\\n“then, _évidemment_, we must find out just how we stand. when did\\nmr. schneider’s death take place?”\\n\\n“three days ago.”\\n\\n“you are sure it was tetanus?”\\n\\n“dead sure.”\\n\\n“it couldn’t have been a case of strychnine poisoning, for\\ninstance?”\\n\\n“no, monsieur poirot. i see what you’re getting at. but it was a\\nclear case of tetanus.”\\n\\n“did you not inject anti-serum?”\\n\\n“certainly we did,” said the doctor dryly. “every conceivable thing\\nthat could be done was tried.”\\n\\n“had you the anti-serum with you?”\\n\\n“no. we procured it from cairo.”\\n\\n“have there been any other cases of tetanus in the camp?”\\n\\n“no, not one.”\\n\\n“are you certain that the death of mr. bleibner was not due to\\ntetanus?”\\n\\n“absolutely plumb certain. he had a scratch upon his thumb which\\nbecame poisoned, and septicæmia set in. it sounds pretty much the\\nsame to a layman, i dare say, but the two things are entirely\\ndifferent.”\\n\\n“then we have four deaths—all totally dissimilar, one heart failure,\\none blood poisoning, one suicide and one tetanus.”\\n\\n“exactly, monsieur poirot.”\\n\\n“are you certain that there is nothing which might link the four\\ntogether?”\\n\\n“i don’t quite understand you?”\\n\\n“i will put it plainly. was any act committed by those four men\\nwhich might seem to denote disrespect to the spirit of men-her-ra?”\\n\\nthe doctor gazed at poirot in astonishment.\\n\\n“you’re talking through your hat, monsieur poirot. surely you’ve\\nnot been guyed into believing all that fool talk?”\\n\\n“absolute nonsense,” muttered willard angrily.\\n\\npoirot remained placidly immovable, blinking a little out of his\\ngreen cat’s eyes.\\n\\n“so you do not believe it, _monsieur le docteur_?”\\n\\n“no, sir, i do not,” declared the doctor emphatically. “i am a\\nscientific man, and i believe only what science teaches.”\\n\\n“was there no science then in ancient egypt?” asked poirot softly.\\nhe did not wait for a reply, and indeed dr. ames seemed rather at\\na loss for the moment. “no, no, do not answer me, but tell me this.\\nwhat do the native workmen think?”\\n\\n“i guess,” said dr. ames, “that, where white folk lose their heads,\\nnatives aren’t going to be far behind. i’ll admit that they’re\\ngetting what you might call scared—but they’ve no cause to be.”\\n\\n“i wonder,” said poirot non-committally.\\n\\nsir guy leant forward.\\n\\n“surely,” he cried incredulously, “you cannot believe in—oh, but\\nthe thing’s absurd! you can know nothing of ancient egypt if you\\nthink that.”\\n\\nfor answer poirot produced a little book from his pocket—an ancient\\ntattered volume. as he held it out i saw its title, _the magic of\\nthe egyptians and chaldeans_. then, wheeling round, he strode out\\nof the tent. the doctor stared at me.\\n\\n“what is his little idea?”\\n\\nthe phrase, so familiar on poirot’s lips, made me smile as it came\\nfrom another.\\n\\n“i don’t know exactly,” i confessed. “he’s got some plan of\\nexorcizing the evil spirits, i believe.”\\n\\ni went in search of poirot, and found him talking to the lean-faced\\nyoung man who had been the late mr. bleibner’s secretary.\\n\\n“no,” mr. harper was saying, “i’ve only been six months with the\\nexpedition. yes, i knew mr. bleibner’s affairs pretty well.”\\n\\n“can you recount to me anything concerning his nephew?”\\n\\n“he turned up here one day, not a bad-looking fellow. i’d never\\nmet him before, but some of the others had—ames, i think, and\\nschneider. the old man wasn’t at all pleased to see him. they were\\nat it in no time, hammer and tongs. ‘not a cent,’ the old man\\nshouted. ‘not one cent now or when i’m dead. i intend to leave my\\nmoney to the furtherance of my life’s work. i’ve been talking it\\nover with mr. schneider to-day.’ and a bit more of the same. young\\nbleibner lit out for cairo right away.”\\n\\n“was he in perfectly good health at the time?”\\n\\n“the old man?”\\n\\n“no, the young one.”\\n\\n“i believe he did mention there was something wrong with him. but\\nit couldn’t have been anything serious, or i should have remembered.”\\n\\n“one thing more, has mr. bleibner left a will?”\\n\\n“so far as we know, he has not.”\\n\\n“are you remaining with the expedition, mr. harper?”\\n\\n“no, sir, i am not. i’m for new york as soon as i can square up\\nthings here. you may laugh if you like, but i’m not going to be\\nthis blasted old men-her-ra’s next victim. he’ll get me if i stop\\nhere.”\\n\\nthe young man wiped the perspiration from his brow.\\n\\npoirot turned away. over his shoulder he said with a peculiar\\nsmile:\\n\\n“remember, he got one of his victims in new york.”\\n\\n“oh, hell!” said mr. harper forcibly.\\n\\n“that young man is nervous,” said poirot thoughtfully. “he is on\\nthe edge, but absolutely on the edge.”\\n\\ni glanced at poirot curiously, but his enigmatical smile told me\\nnothing. in company with sir guy willard and dr. tosswill we were\\ntaken round the excavations. the principal finds had been removed\\nto cairo, but some of the tomb furniture was extremely interesting.\\nthe enthusiasm of the young baronet was obvious, but i fancied that\\ni detected a shade of nervousness in his manner as though he could\\nnot quite escape from the feeling of menace in the air. as we\\nentered the tent which had been assigned to us, for a wash before\\njoining the evening meal, a tall dark figure in white robes stood\\naside to let us pass with a graceful gesture and a murmured greeting\\nin arabic. poirot stopped.\\n\\n“you are hassan, the late sir john willard’s servant?”\\n\\n“i served my lord sir john, now i serve his son.” he took a step\\nnearer to us and lowered his voice. “you are a wise one, they say,\\nlearned in dealing with evil spirits. let the young master depart\\nfrom here. there is evil in the air around us.”\\n\\nand with an abrupt gesture, not waiting for a reply, he strode\\naway.\\n\\n“evil in the air,” muttered poirot. “yes, i feel it.”\\n\\nour meal was hardly a cheerful one. the floor was left to dr.\\ntosswill, who discoursed at length upon egyptian antiquities. just\\nas we were preparing to retire to rest, sir guy caught poirot by\\nthe arm and pointed. a shadowy figure was moving amidst the tents.\\nit was no human one: i recognized distinctly the dog-headed figure\\ni had seen carved on the walls of the tomb.\\n\\nmy blood literally froze at the sight.\\n\\n“_mon dieu!_” murmured poirot, crossing himself vigorously. “anubis,\\nthe jackal-headed, the god of departing souls.”\\n\\n“some one is hoaxing us,” cried dr. tosswill, rising indignantly\\nto his feet.\\n\\n“it went into your tent, harper,” muttered sir guy, his face\\ndreadfully pale.\\n\\n“no,” said poirot, shaking his head, “into that of the dr. ames.”\\n\\nthe doctor stared at him incredulously; then, repeating dr.\\ntosswill’s words, he cried:\\n\\n“some one is hoaxing us. come, we’ll soon catch the fellow.”\\n\\nhe dashed energetically in pursuit of the shadowy apparition. i\\nfollowed him, but, search as we would, we could find no trace of\\nany living soul having passed that way. we returned, somewhat\\ndisturbed in mind, to find poirot taking energetic measures, in\\nhis own way, to ensure his personal safety. he was busily\\nsurrounding our tent with various diagrams and inscriptions which\\nhe was drawing in the sand. i recognized the five-pointed star or\\npentagon many times repeated. as was his wont, poirot was at the\\nsame time delivering an impromptu lecture on witchcraft and magic\\nin general, white magic as opposed to black, with various references\\nto the ka and the book of the dead thrown in.\\n\\nit appeared to excite the liveliest contempt in dr. tosswill, who\\ndrew me aside, literally snorting with rage.\\n\\n“balderdash, sir,” he exclaimed angrily. “pure balderdash. the\\nman’s an impostor. he doesn’t know the difference between the\\nsuperstitions of the middle ages and the beliefs of ancient egypt.\\nnever have i heard such a hotch-potch of ignorance and credulity.”\\n\\ni calmed the excited expert, and joined poirot in the tent. my\\nlittle friend was beaming cheerfully.\\n\\n“we can now sleep in peace,” he declared happily. “and i can do\\nwith some sleep. my head, it aches abominably. ah, for a good\\n_tisane_!”\\n\\nas though in answer to prayer, the flap of the tent was lifted and\\nhassan appeared, bearing a steaming cup which he offered to poirot.\\nit proved to be camomile tea, a beverage of which he is inordinately\\nfond. having thanked hassan and refused his offer of another cup\\nfor myself, we were left alone once more. i stood at the door of\\nthe tent some time after undressing, looking out over the desert.\\n\\n“a wonderful place,” i said aloud, “and a wonderful work. i can\\nfeel the fascination. this desert life, this probing into the heart\\nof a vanished civilization. surely, poirot, you, too, must feel\\nthe charm?”\\n\\ni got no answer, and i turned, a little annoyed. my annoyance was\\nquickly changed to concern. poirot was lying back across the rude\\ncouch, his face horribly convulsed. beside him was the empty cup.\\ni rushed to his side, then dashed out and across the camp to dr.\\names’s tent.\\n\\n“dr. ames!” i cried. “come at once.”\\n\\n“what’s the matter?” said the doctor, appearing in pyjamas.\\n\\n“my friend. he’s ill. dying. the camomile tea. don’t let hassan\\nleave the camp.”\\n\\nlike a flash the doctor ran to our tent. poirot was lying as i left\\nhim.\\n\\n“extraordinary,” cried ames. “looks like a seizure—or—what did you\\nsay about something he drank?” he picked up the empty cup.\\n\\n“only i did not drink it!” said a placid voice.\\n\\nwe turned in amazement. poirot was sitting up on the bed. he was\\nsmiling.\\n\\n“no,” he said gently. “i did not drink it. while my good friend\\nhastings was apostrophizing the night, i took the opportunity of\\npouring it, not down my throat, but into a little bottle. that\\nlittle bottle will go to the analytical chemist. no”—as the doctor\\nmade a sudden movement—“as a sensible man, you will understand that\\nviolence will be of no avail. during hastings’ brief absence to\\nfetch you, i have had time to put the bottle in safe keeping. ah,\\nquick, hastings, hold him!”\\n\\ni misunderstood poirot’s anxiety. eager to save my friend, i flung\\nmyself in front of him. but the doctor’s swift movement had another\\nmeaning. his hand went to his mouth, a smell of bitter almonds\\nfilled the air, and he swayed forward and fell.\\n\\n“another victim,” said poirot gravely, “but the last. perhaps it\\nis the best way. he has three deaths on his head.”\\n\\n“dr. ames?” i cried, stupefied. “but i thought you believed in some\\noccult influence?”\\n\\n“you misunderstood me, hastings. what i meant was that i believe\\nin the terrific force of superstition. once get it firmly\\nestablished that a series of deaths are supernatural, and you might\\nalmost stab a man in broad daylight, and it would still be put down\\nto the curse, so strongly is the instinct of the supernatural\\nimplanted in the human race. i suspected from the first that a man\\nwas taking advantage of that instinct. the idea came to him, i\\nimagine, with the death of sir john willard. a fury of superstition\\narose at once. as far as i could see, nobody could derive any\\nparticular profit from sir john’s death. mr. bleibner was a\\ndifferent case. he was a man of great wealth. the information i\\nreceived from new york contained several suggestive points. to\\nbegin with, young bleibner was reported to have said he had a good\\nfriend in egypt from whom he could borrow. it was tacitly understood\\nthat he meant his uncle, but it seemed to me that in that case he\\nwould have said so outright. the words suggest some boon companion\\nof his own. another thing, he scraped up enough money to take him\\nto egypt, his uncle refused outright to advance him a penny, yet\\nhe was able to pay the return passage to new york. some one must\\nhave lent him the money.”\\n\\n“all that was very thin,” i objected.\\n\\n“but there was more. hastings, there occur often enough words\\nspoken metaphorically which are taken literally. the opposite can\\nhappen too. in this case, words which were meant literally were\\ntaken metaphorically. young bleibner wrote plainly enough: ‘i am\\na leper,’ but nobody realized that he shot himself because he\\nbelieved that he had contracted the dread disease of leprosy.”\\n\\n“what?” i ejaculated.\\n\\n“it was the clever invention of a diabolical mind. young bleibner\\nwas suffering from some minor skin trouble, he had lived in the\\nsouth sea islands, where the disease is common enough. ames was a\\nformer friend of his, and a well-known medical man, he would never\\ndream of doubting his word. when i arrived here, my suspicions were\\ndivided between harper and dr. ames, but i soon realized that only\\nthe doctor could have perpetrated and concealed the crimes, and i\\nlearnt from harper that he was previously acquainted with young\\nbleibner. doubtless the latter at some time or another had made a\\nwill or had insured his life in favour of the doctor. the latter\\nsaw his chance of acquiring wealth. it was easy for him to inoculate\\nmr. bleibner with the deadly germs. then the nephew, overcome with\\ndespair at the dread news his friend had conveyed to him, shot\\nhimself. mr. bleibner, whatever his intentions, had made no will.\\nhis fortune would pass to his nephew and from him to the doctor.”\\n\\n“and mr. schneider?”\\n\\n“we cannot be sure. he knew young bleibner too, remember, and may\\nhave suspected something, or, again, the doctor may have thought\\nthat a further death motiveless and purposeless would strengthen\\nthe coils of superstition. furthermore, i will tell you an\\ninteresting psychological fact, hastings. a murderer has always a\\nstrong desire to repeat his successful crime, the performance of\\nit grows upon him. hence my fears for young willard. the figure of\\nanubis you saw to-night was hassan, dressed up by my orders. i\\nwanted to see if i could frighten the doctor. but it would take\\nmore than the supernatural to frighten him. i could see that he\\nwas not entirely taken in by my pretences of belief in the occult.\\nthe little comedy i played for him did not deceive him. i suspected\\nthat he would endeavour to make me the next victim. ah, but in\\nspite of _la mer maudite_, the heat abominable, and the annoyances\\nof the sand, the little grey cells still functioned!”\\n\\npoirot proved to be perfectly right in his premises. young bleibner,\\nsome years ago, in a fit of drunken merriment, had made a jocular\\nwill, leaving “my cigarette case you admire so much and everything\\nelse of which i die possessed which will be principally debts to\\nmy good friend robert ames who once saved my life from drowning.”\\n\\nthe case was hushed up as far as possible, and, to this day, people\\ntalk of the remarkable series of deaths in connection with the tomb\\nof men-her-ra as a triumphal proof of the vengeance of a bygone\\nking upon the desecrators of his tomb—a belief which, as poirot\\npointed out to me, is contrary to all egyptian belief and thought.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  vii\\n\\n  the jewel robbery at the _grand metropolitan_\\n\\n“poirot,” i said, “a change of air would do you good.”\\n\\n“you think so, _mon ami_?”\\n\\n“i am sure of it.”\\n\\n“eh—eh?” said my friend, smiling. “it is all arranged, then?”\\n\\n“you will come?”\\n\\n“where do you propose to take me?”\\n\\n“brighton. as a matter of fact, a friend of mine in the city put\\nme on to a very good thing, and—well, i have money to burn, as the\\nsaying goes. i think a week-end at the _grand metropolitan_ would\\ndo us all the good in the world.”\\n\\n“thank you, i accept most gratefully. you have the good heart to\\nthink of an old man. and the good heart, it is in the end worth\\nall the little grey cells. yes, yes, i who speak to you am in\\ndanger of forgetting that sometimes.”\\n\\ni did not quite relish the implication. i fancy that poirot is\\nsometimes a little inclined to underestimate my mental capacities.\\nbut his pleasure was so evident that i put my slight annoyance\\naside.\\n\\n“then, that’s all right,” i said hastily.\\n\\nsaturday evening saw us dining at the _grand metropolitan_ in the\\nmidst of a gay throng. all the world and his wife seemed to be at\\nbrighton. the dresses were marvellous, and the jewels—worn sometimes\\nwith more love of display than good taste—were something magnificent.\\n\\n“_hein_, it is a sight this!” murmured poirot. “this is the home\\nof the profiteer, is it not so, hastings?”\\n\\n“supposed to be,” i replied. “but we’ll hope they aren’t all tarred\\nwith the profiteering brush.”\\n\\npoirot gazed round him placidly.\\n\\n“the sight of so many jewels makes me wish i had turned my brains\\nto crime, instead of to its detection. what a magnificent\\nopportunity for some thief of distinction! regard, hastings, that\\nstout woman by the pillar. she is, as you would say, plastered with\\ngems.”\\n\\ni followed his eyes.\\n\\n“why,” i exclaimed, “it’s mrs. opalsen.”\\n\\n“you know her?”\\n\\n“slightly. her husband is a rich stockbroker who made a fortune in\\nthe recent oil boom.”\\n\\nafter dinner we ran across the opalsens in the lounge, and i\\nintroduced poirot to them. we chatted for a few minutes, and ended\\nby having our coffee together.\\n\\npoirot said a few words in praise of some of the costlier gems\\ndisplayed on the lady’s ample bosom, and she brightened up at once.\\n\\n“it’s a perfect hobby of mine, mr. poirot. i just _love_ jewellery.\\ned knows my weakness, and every time things go well he brings me\\nsomething new. you are interested in precious stones?”\\n\\n“i have had a good deal to do with them one time and another,\\nmadame. my profession has brought me into contact with some of the\\nmost famous jewels in the world.”\\n\\nhe went on to narrate, with discreet pseudonyms, the story of the\\nhistoric jewels of a reigning house, and mrs. opalsen listened with\\nbated breath.\\n\\n“there now!” she exclaimed, as he ended. “if it isn’t just like a\\nplay! you know, i’ve got some pearls of my own that have a history\\nattached to them. i believe it’s supposed to be one of the finest\\nnecklaces in the world—the pearls are so beautifully matched and\\nso perfect in colour. i declare i really must run up and get it!”\\n\\n“oh, madame,” protested poirot, “you are too amiable. pray do not\\nderange yourself!”\\n\\n“oh, but i’d like to show it to you.”\\n\\nthe buxom dame waddled across to the lift briskly enough. her\\nhusband, who had been talking to me, looked at poirot inquiringly.\\n\\n“madame your wife is so amiable as to insist on showing me her\\npearl necklace,” explained the latter.\\n\\n“oh, the pearls!” opalsen smiled in a satisfied fashion. “well,\\nthey _are_ worth seeing. cost a pretty penny too! still, the\\nmoney’s there all right; i could get what i paid for them any\\nday—perhaps more. may have to, too, if things go on as they are\\nnow. money’s confoundedly tight in the city. all this infernal\\ne.p.d.” he rambled on, launching into technicalities where i could\\nnot follow him.\\n\\nhe was interrupted by a small page-boy who approached and murmured\\nsomething in his ear.\\n\\n“eh—what? i’ll come at once. not taken ill, is she? excuse me,\\ngentlemen.”\\n\\nhe left us abruptly. poirot leaned back and lit one of his tiny\\nrussian cigarettes. then, carefully and meticulously, he arranged\\nthe empty coffee-cups in a neat row, and beamed happily on the\\nresult.\\n\\nthe minutes passed. the opalsens did not return.\\n\\n“curious,” i remarked, at length. “i wonder when they will come\\nback.”\\n\\npoirot watched the ascending spirals of smoke, and then said\\nthoughtfully:\\n\\n“they will not come back.”\\n\\n“why?”\\n\\n“because, my friend, something has happened.”\\n\\n“what sort of thing? how do you know?” i asked curiously.\\n\\npoirot smiled.\\n\\n“a few moments ago the manager came hurriedly out of his office\\nand ran upstairs. he was much agitated. the lift-boy is deep in\\ntalk with one of the pages. the lift-bell has rung three times,\\nbut he heeds it not. thirdly, even the waiters are _distrait_; and\\nto make a waiter _distrait_——” poirot shook his head with an air\\nof finality. “the affair must indeed be of the first magnitude.\\nah, it is as i thought! here come the police.”\\n\\ntwo men had just entered the hotel—one in uniform, the other in\\nplain clothes. they spoke to a page, and were immediately ushered\\nupstairs. a few minutes later, the same boy descended and came up\\nto where we were sitting.\\n\\n“mr. opalsen’s compliments, and would you step upstairs.”\\n\\npoirot sprang nimbly to his feet. one would have said that he\\nawaited the summons. i followed with no less alacrity.\\n\\nthe opalsens’ apartments were situated on the first floor. after\\nknocking on the door, the page-boy retired, and we answered the\\nsummons, “come in!” a strange scene met our eyes. the room was mrs.\\nopalsen’s bedroom, and in the centre of it, lying back in an\\narm-chair, was the lady herself, weeping violently. she presented\\nan extraordinary spectacle, with the tears making great furrows in\\nthe powder with which her complexion was liberally coated. mr.\\nopalsen was striding up and down angrily. the two police officials\\nstood in the middle of the room, one with a notebook in hand. an\\nhotel chambermaid, looking frightened to death, stood by the\\nfire-place; and on the other side of the room a frenchwoman,\\nobviously mrs. opalsen’s maid, was weeping and wringing her hands,\\nwith an intensity of grief that rivalled that of her mistress.\\n\\ninto this pandemonium stepped poirot, neat and smiling. immediately,\\nwith an energy surprising in one of her bulk, mrs. opalsen sprang\\nfrom her chair towards him.\\n\\n“there now; ed may say what he likes, but i believe in luck, i do.\\nit was fated i should meet you the way i did this evening, and i’ve\\na feeling that if you can’t get my pearls back for me nobody can.”\\n\\n“calm yourself, i pray of you, madame.” poirot patted her hand\\nsoothingly. “reassure yourself. all will be well. hercule poirot\\nwill aid you!”\\n\\nmr. opalsen turned to the police inspector.\\n\\n“there will be no objection to my—er—calling in this gentleman, i\\nsuppose?”\\n\\n“none at all, sir,” replied the man civilly, but with complete\\nindifference. “perhaps now your lady’s feeling better she’ll just\\nlet us have the facts?”\\n\\nmrs. opalsen looked helplessly at poirot. he led her back to her\\nchair.\\n\\n“seat yourself, madame, and recount to us the whole history without\\nagitating yourself.”\\n\\nthus abjured, mrs. opalsen dried her eyes gingerly, and began.\\n\\n“i came upstairs after dinner to fetch my pearls for mr. poirot\\nhere to see. the chambermaid and célestine were both in the room\\nas usual——”\\n\\n“excuse me, madame, but what do you mean by ‘as usual’?”\\n\\nmr. opalsen explained.\\n\\n“i make it a rule that no one is to come into this room unless\\ncélestine, the maid, is there also. the chambermaid does the room\\nin the morning while célestine is present, and comes in after\\ndinner to turn down the beds under the same conditions; otherwise\\nshe never enters the room.”\\n\\n“well, as i was saying,” continued mrs. opalsen, “i came up. i went\\nto the drawer here,”—she indicated the bottom right-hand drawer of\\nthe knee-hole dressing-table—“took out my jewel-case and unlocked\\nit. it seemed quite as usual—but the pearls were not there!”\\n\\nthe inspector had been busy with his notebook. “when had you last\\nseen them?” he asked.\\n\\n“they were there when i went down to dinner.”\\n\\n“you are sure?”\\n\\n“quite sure. i was uncertain whether to wear them or not, but in\\nthe end i decided on the emeralds, and put them back in the\\njewel-case.”\\n\\n“who locked up the jewel-case?”\\n\\n“i did. i wear the key on a chain round my neck.” she held it up\\nas she spoke.\\n\\nthe inspector examined it, and shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“the thief must have had a duplicate key. no difficult matter. the\\nlock is quite a simple one. what did you do after you’d locked the\\njewel-case?”\\n\\n“i put it back in the bottom drawer where i always keep it.”\\n\\n“you didn’t lock the drawer?”\\n\\n“no, i never do. my maid remains in the room till i come up, so\\nthere’s no need.”\\n\\nthe inspector’s face grew graver.\\n\\n“am i to understand that the jewels were there when you went down\\nto dinner, and that since then _the maid has not left the room_?”\\n\\nsuddenly, as though the horror of her own situation for the first\\ntime burst upon her, célestine uttered a piercing shriek, and,\\nflinging herself upon poirot, poured out a torrent of incoherent\\nfrench.\\n\\nthe suggestion was infamous! that she should be suspected of\\nrobbing madame! the police were well known to be of a stupidity\\nincredible! but monsieur, who was a frenchman—\\n\\n“a belgian,” interjected poirot, but célestine paid no attention\\nto the correction.\\n\\nmonsieur would not stand by and see her falsely accused, while that\\ninfamous chambermaid was allowed to go scot-free. she had never\\nliked her—a bold, red-faced thing—a born thief. she had said from\\nthe first that she was not honest. and had kept a sharp watch over\\nher too, when she was doing madame’s room! let those idiots of\\npolicemen search her, and if they did not find madame’s pearls on\\nher it would be very surprising!\\n\\nalthough this harangue was uttered in rapid and virulent french,\\ncélestine had interlarded it with a wealth of gesture, and the\\nchambermaid realized at least a part of her meaning. she reddened\\nangrily.\\n\\n“if that foreign woman’s saying i took the pearls, it’s a lie!”\\nshe declared heatedly. “i never so much as saw them.”\\n\\n“search her!” screamed the other. “you will find it is as i say.”\\n\\n“you’re a liar—do you hear?” said the chambermaid, advancing upon\\nher. “stole ’em yourself, and want to put it on me. why, i was only\\nin the room about three minutes before the lady come up, and then\\nyou were sitting here the whole time, as you always do, like a cat\\nwatching a mouse.”\\n\\nthe inspector looked across inquiringly at célestine. “is that\\ntrue? didn’t you leave the room at all?”\\n\\n“i did not actually leave her alone,” admitted célestine reluctantly,\\n“but i went into my own room through the door here twice—once to\\nfetch a reel of cotton, and once for my scissors. she must have\\ndone it then.”\\n\\n“you wasn’t gone a minute,” retorted the chambermaid angrily. “just\\npopped out and in again. i’d be glad if the police _would_ search\\nme. _i’ve nothing to be afraid of_.”\\n\\nat this moment there was a tap at the door. the inspector went to\\nit. his face brightened when he saw who it was.\\n\\n“ah!” he said. “that’s rather fortunate. i sent for one of our\\nfemale searchers, and she’s just arrived. perhaps if you wouldn’t\\nmind going into the room next door.”\\n\\nhe looked at the chambermaid, who stepped across the threshold with\\na toss of her head, the searcher following her closely.\\n\\nthe french girl had sunk sobbing into a chair. poirot was looking\\nround the room, the main features of which i have made clear by a\\nsketch.\\n\\n[a sketch of the bedroom, adjoining maid's room, and corridor.]\\n\\n“where does that door lead?” he inquired, nodding his head towards\\nthe one by the window.\\n\\n“into the next apartment, i believe,” said the inspector. “it’s\\nbolted, anyway, on this side.”\\n\\npoirot walked across to it, tried it, then drew back the bolt and\\ntried it again.\\n\\n“and on the other side as well,” he remarked. “well, that seems to\\nrule out that.”\\n\\nhe walked over to the windows, examining each of them in turn.\\n\\n“and again—nothing. not even a balcony outside.”\\n\\n“even if there were,” said the inspector impatiently, “i don’t see\\nhow that would help us, if the maid never left the room.”\\n\\n“_évidemment_,” said poirot, not disconcerted. “as mademoiselle is\\npositive she did not leave the room——”\\n\\nhe was interrupted by the reappearance of the chambermaid and the\\npolice searcher.\\n\\n“nothing,” said the latter laconically.\\n\\n“i should hope not, indeed,” said the chambermaid virtuously. “and\\nthat french hussy ought to be ashamed of herself taking away an\\nhonest girl’s character!”\\n\\n“there, there, my girl; that’s all right,” said the inspector,\\nopening the door. “nobody suspects you. you go along and get on\\nwith your work.”\\n\\nthe chambermaid went unwillingly.\\n\\n“going to search _her_?” she demanded, pointing at célestine.\\n\\n“yes, yes!” he shut the door on her and turned the key.\\n\\ncélestine accompanied the searcher into the small room in her turn.\\na few minutes later she also returned. nothing had been found on\\nher.\\n\\nthe inspector’s face grew graver.\\n\\n“i’m afraid i’ll have to ask you to come along with me all the\\nsame, miss.” he turned to mrs. opalsen. “i’m sorry, madam, but all\\nthe evidence points that way. if she’s not got them on her, they’re\\nhidden somewhere about the room.”\\n\\ncélestine uttered a piercing shriek, and clung to poirot’s arm.\\nthe latter bent and whispered something in the girl’s ear. she\\nlooked up at him doubtfully.\\n\\n“_si, si, mon enfant_—i assure you it is better not to resist.”\\nthen he turned to the inspector. “you permit, monsieur? a little\\nexperiment—purely for my own satisfaction.”\\n\\n“depends on what it is,” replied the police officer non-committally.\\n\\npoirot addressed célestine once more.\\n\\n“you have told us that you went into your room to fetch a reel of\\ncotton. whereabouts was it?”\\n\\n“on the top of the chest of drawers, monsieur.”\\n\\n“and the scissors?”\\n\\n“they also.”\\n\\n“would it be troubling you too much, mademoiselle, to ask you to\\nrepeat those two actions? you were sitting here with your work,\\nyou say?”\\n\\ncélestine sat down, and then, at a sign from poirot, rose, passed\\ninto the adjoining room, took up an object from the chest of\\ndrawers, and returned.\\n\\npoirot divided his attention between her movements and a large\\nturnip of a watch which he held in the palm of his hand.\\n\\n“again, if you please, mademoiselle.”\\n\\nat the conclusion of the second performance, he made a note in his\\npocket-book, and returned the watch to his pocket.\\n\\n“thank you, mademoiselle. and you, monsieur,”—he bowed to the\\ninspector—“for your courtesy.”\\n\\nthe inspector seemed somewhat entertained by this excessive\\npoliteness. célestine departed in a flood of tears, accompanied by\\nthe woman and the plain-clothes official.\\n\\nthen, with a brief apology to mrs. opalsen, the inspector set to\\nwork to ransack the room. he pulled out drawers, opened cupboards,\\ncompletely unmade the bed, and tapped the floor. mr. opalsen looked\\non sceptically.\\n\\n“you really think you will find them?”\\n\\n“yes, sir. it stands to reason. she hadn’t time to take them out\\nof the room. the lady’s discovering the robbery so soon upset her\\nplans. no, they’re here right enough. one of the two must have\\nhidden them—and it’s very unlikely for the chambermaid to have done\\nso.”\\n\\n“more than unlikely—impossible!” said poirot quietly.\\n\\n“eh?” the inspector stared.\\n\\npoirot smiled modestly.\\n\\n“i will demonstrate. hastings, my good friend, take my watch in\\nyour hand—with care. it is a family heirloom! just now i timed\\nmademoiselle’s movements—her first absence from the room was of\\ntwelve seconds, her second of fifteen. now observe my actions.\\nmadame will have the kindness to give me the key of the jewel-case.\\ni thank you. my friend hastings will have the kindness to say\\n‘go!’”\\n\\n“go!” i said.\\n\\nwith almost incredible swiftness, poirot wrenched open the drawer\\nof the dressing-table, extracted the jewel-case, fitted the key in\\nthe lock, opened the case, selected a piece of jewellery, shut and\\nlocked the case, and returned it to the drawer, which he pushed to\\nagain. his movements were like lightning.\\n\\n“well, _mon ami_?” he demanded of me breathlessly.\\n\\n“forty-six seconds,” i replied.\\n\\n“you see?” he looked round. “there would not have been time for\\nthe chambermaid even to take the necklace out, far less hide it.”\\n\\n“then that settles it on the maid,” said the inspector with\\nsatisfaction, and returned to his search. he passed into the maid’s\\nbedroom next door.\\n\\npoirot was frowning thoughtfully. suddenly he shot a question at\\nmr. opalsen.\\n\\n“this necklace—it was, without doubt, insured?”\\n\\nmr. opalsen looked a trifle surprised at the question.\\n\\n“yes,” he said hesitatingly, “that is so.”\\n\\n“but what does that matter?” broke in mrs. opalsen tearfully. “it’s\\nmy necklace i want. it was unique. no money could be the same.”\\n\\n“i comprehend, madame,” said poirot soothingly. “i comprehend\\nperfectly. to _la femme_ sentiment is everything—is it not so? but\\nmonsieur, who has not the so fine susceptibility, will doubtless\\nfind some slight consolation in the fact.”\\n\\n“of course, of course,” said mr. opalsen rather uncertainly.\\n“still——”\\n\\nhe was interrupted by a shout of triumph from the inspector. he\\ncame in dangling something from his fingers.\\n\\nwith a cry, mrs. opalsen heaved herself up from her chair. she was\\na changed woman.\\n\\n“oh, oh, my necklace!”\\n\\nshe clasped it to her breast with both hands. we crowded round.\\n\\n“where was it?” demanded opalsen.\\n\\n“maid’s bed. in among the springs of the wire mattress. she must\\nhave stolen it and hidden it there before the chambermaid arrived\\non the scene.”\\n\\n“you permit, madame?” said poirot gently. he took the necklace from\\nher and examined it closely; then handed it back with a bow.\\n\\n“i’m afraid, madam, you’ll have to hand it over to us for the time\\nbeing,” said the inspector. “we shall want it for the charge. but\\nit shall be returned to you as soon as possible.”\\n\\nmr. opalsen frowned.\\n\\n“is that necessary?”\\n\\n“i’m afraid so, sir. just a formality.”\\n\\n“oh, let him take it, ed!” cried his wife. “i’d feel safer if he\\ndid. i shouldn’t sleep a wink thinking some one else might try and\\nget hold of it. that wretched girl! and i would never have believed\\nit of her.”\\n\\n“there, there, my dear, don’t take on so.”\\n\\ni felt a gentle pressure on my arm. it was poirot.\\n\\n“shall we slip away, my friend? i think our services are no longer\\nneeded.”\\n\\nonce outside, however, he hesitated, and then, much to my surprise,\\nhe remarked:\\n\\n“i should rather like to see the room next door.”\\n\\nthe door was not locked, and we entered. the room, which was a\\nlarge double one, was unoccupied. dust lay about rather noticeably,\\nand my sensitive friend gave a characteristic grimace as he ran\\nhis finger round a rectangular mark on a table near the window.\\n\\n“the _service_ leaves to be desired,” he observed dryly.\\n\\nhe was staring thoughtfully out of the window, and seemed to have\\nfallen into a brown study.\\n\\n“well?” i demanded impatiently. “what did we come in here for?”\\n\\nhe started.\\n\\n“_je vous demande pardon, mon ami_. i wished to see if the door\\nwas really bolted on this side also.”\\n\\n“well,” i said, glancing at the door which communicated with the\\nroom we had just left, “it _is_ bolted.”\\n\\npoirot nodded. he still seemed to be thinking.\\n\\n“and, anyway,” i continued, “what does it matter? the case is over.\\ni wish you’d had more chance of distinguishing yourself. but it\\nwas the kind of case that even a stiff-backed idiot like that\\ninspector couldn’t go wrong over.”\\n\\npoirot shook his head.\\n\\n“the case is not over, my friend. it will not be over until we find\\nout who stole the pearls.”\\n\\n“but the maid did!”\\n\\n“why do you say that?”\\n\\n“why,” i stammered, “they were found—actually in her mattress.”\\n\\n“ta, ta, ta!” said poirot impatiently. “those were not the pearls.”\\n\\n“what?”\\n\\n“imitation, _mon ami_.”\\n\\nthe statement took my breath away. poirot was smiling placidly.\\n\\n“the good inspector obviously knows nothing of jewels. but presently\\nthere will be a fine hullabaloo!”\\n\\n“come!” i cried, dragging at his arm.\\n\\n“where?”\\n\\n“we must tell the opalsens at once.”\\n\\n“i think not.”\\n\\n“but that poor woman——”\\n\\n“_eh bien_; that poor woman, as you call her, will have a much\\nbetter night believing the jewels to be safe.”\\n\\n“but the thief may escape with them!”\\n\\n“as usual, my friend, you speak without reflection. how do you know\\nthat the pearls mrs. opalsen locked up so carefully to-night were\\nnot the false ones, and that the real robbery did not take place\\nat a much earlier date?”\\n\\n“oh!” i said, bewildered.\\n\\n“exactly,” said poirot, beaming. “we start again.”\\n\\nhe led the way out of the room, paused a moment as though\\nconsidering, and then walked down to the end of the corridor,\\nstopping outside the small den where the chambermaids and valets\\nof the respective floors congregated. our particular chambermaid\\nappeared to be holding a small court there, and to be retailing\\nher late experiences to an appreciative audience. she stopped in\\nthe middle of a sentence. poirot bowed with his usual politeness.\\n\\n“excuse that i derange you, but i shall be obliged if you will\\nunlock for me the door of mr. opalsen’s room.”\\n\\nthe woman rose willingly, and we accompanied her down the passage\\nagain. mr. opalsen’s room was on the other side of the corridor,\\nits door facing that of his wife’s room. the chambermaid unlocked\\nit with her pass-key, and we entered.\\n\\nas she was about to depart poirot detained her.\\n\\n“one moment; have you ever seen among the effects of mr. opalsen\\na card like this?”\\n\\nhe held out a plain white card, rather highly glazed and uncommon\\nin appearance. the maid took it and scrutinized it carefully.\\n\\n“no, sir, i can’t say i have. but, anyway, the valet has most to\\ndo with the gentlemen’s rooms.”\\n\\n“i see. thank you.”\\n\\npoirot took back the card. the woman departed. poirot appeared to\\nreflect a little. then he gave a short, sharp nod of the head.\\n\\n“ring the bell, i pray of you, hastings. three times, for the\\nvalet.”\\n\\ni obeyed, devoured with curiosity. meanwhile poirot had emptied\\nthe waste-paper-basket on the floor, and was swiftly going through\\nits contents.\\n\\nin a few moments the valet answered the bell. to him poirot put\\nthe same question, and handed him the card to examine. but the\\nresponse was the same. the valet had never seen a card of that\\nparticular quality among mr. opalsen’s belongings. poirot thanked\\nhim, and he withdrew, somewhat unwillingly, with an inquisitive\\nglance at the overturned waste-paper-basket and the litter on the\\nfloor. he could hardly have helped overhearing poirot’s thoughtful\\nremark as he bundled the torn papers back again:\\n\\n“and the necklace was heavily insured. . . .”\\n\\n“poirot,” i cried,  “i see——”\\n\\n“you see nothing, my friend,” he replied quickly. “as usual,\\nnothing at all! it is incredible—but there it is. let us return to\\nour own apartments.”\\n\\nwe did so in silence. once there, to my intense surprise, poirot\\neffected a rapid change of clothing.\\n\\n“i go to london to-night,” he explained. “it is imperative.”\\n\\n“what?”\\n\\n“absolutely. the real work, that of the brain (ah, those brave\\nlittle grey cells), it is done. i go to seek the confirmation. i\\nshall find it! impossible to deceive hercule poirot!”\\n\\n“you’ll come a cropper one of these days,” i observed, rather\\ndisgusted by his vanity.\\n\\n“do not be enraged, i beg of you, _mon ami_. i count on you to do\\nme a service—of your friendship.”\\n\\n“of course,” i said eagerly, rather ashamed of my moroseness. “what\\nis it?”\\n\\n“the sleeve of my coat that i have taken off—will you brush it?\\nsee you, a little white powder has clung to it. you without doubt\\nobserved me run my finger round the drawer of the dressing-table?”\\n\\n“no, i didn’t.”\\n\\n“you should observe my actions, my friend. thus i obtained the\\npowder on my finger, and, being a little over-excited, i rubbed it\\non my sleeve; an action without method which i deplore—false to\\nall my principles.”\\n\\n“but what was the powder?” i asked, not particularly interested in\\npoirot’s principles.\\n\\n“not the poison of the borgias,” replied poirot, with a twinkle.\\n“i see your imagination mounting. i should say it was french\\nchalk.”\\n\\n“french chalk?”\\n\\n“yes, cabinet-makers use it to make drawers run smoothly.”\\n\\ni laughed.\\n\\n“you old sinner! i thought you were working up to something\\nexciting.”\\n\\n“au revoir, my friend. i save myself. i fly!”\\n\\nthe door shut behind him. with a smile, half of derision, half of\\naffection, i picked up the coat, and stretched out my hand for the\\nclothes-brush.\\n\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\n\\nthe next morning, hearing nothing from poirot, i went out for a\\nstroll, met some old friends, and lunched with them at their hotel.\\nin the afternoon we went for a spin. a punctured tyre delayed us,\\nand it was past eight when i got back to the _grand metropolitan_.\\n\\nthe first sight that met my eyes was poirot, looking even more\\ndiminutive than usual, sandwiched between the opalsens, beaming in\\na state of placid satisfaction.\\n\\n“_mon ami_ hastings!” he cried, and sprang to meet me. “embrace\\nme, my friend; all has marched to a marvel!”\\n\\nluckily, the embrace was merely figurative—not a thing one is\\nalways sure of with poirot.\\n\\n“do you mean——” i began.\\n\\n“just wonderful, i call it!” said mrs. opalsen, smiling all over\\nher fat face. “didn’t i tell you, ed, that if he couldn’t get back\\nmy pearls nobody would?”\\n\\n“you did, my dear, you did. and you were right.”\\n\\ni looked helplessly at poirot, and he answered the glance.\\n\\n“my friend hastings is, as you say in england, all at the seaside.\\nseat yourself, and i will recount to you all the affair that has\\nso happily ended.”\\n\\n“ended?”\\n\\n“but yes. they are arrested.”\\n\\n“who are arrested?”\\n\\n“the chambermaid and the valet, _parbleu_! you did not suspect?\\nnot with my parting hint about the french chalk?”\\n\\n“you said cabinet-makers used it.”\\n\\n“certainly they do—to make drawers slide easily. somebody wanted\\nthat drawer to slide in and out without any noise. who could that\\nbe? obviously, only the chambermaid. the plan was so ingenious that\\nit did not at once leap to the eye—not even to the eye of hercule\\npoirot.\\n\\n“listen, this was how it was done. the valet was in the empty room\\nnext door, waiting. the french maid leaves the room. quick as a\\nflash the chambermaid whips open the drawer, takes out the\\njewel-case, and, slipping back the bolt, passes it through the\\ndoor. the valet opens it at his leisure with the duplicate key with\\nwhich he has provided himself, extracts the necklace, and waits\\nhis time. célestine leaves the room again, and—pst!—in a flash the\\ncase is passed back again and replaced in the drawer.\\n\\n“madame arrives, the theft is discovered. the chambermaid demands\\nto be searched, with a good deal of righteous indignation, and\\nleaves the room without a stain on her character. the imitation\\nnecklace with which they have provided themselves has been concealed\\nin the french girl’s bed that morning by the chambermaid—a master\\nstroke, _ça!_”\\n\\n“but what did you go to london for?”\\n\\n“you remember the card?”\\n\\n“certainly. it puzzled me—and puzzles me still. i thought——”\\n\\ni hesitated delicately, glancing at mr. opalsen.\\n\\npoirot laughed heartily.\\n\\n“_une blague!_ for the benefit of the valet. the card was one with\\na specially prepared surface—for finger-prints. i went straight\\nto scotland yard, asked for our old friend inspector japp, and laid\\nthe facts before him. as i had suspected, the finger-prints proved\\nto be those of two well-known jewel thieves who have been ‘wanted’\\nfor some time. japp came down with me, the thieves were arrested,\\nand the necklace was discovered in the valet’s possession. a clever\\npair, but they failed in _method_. have i not told you, hastings,\\nat least thirty-six times, that without method——”\\n\\n“at least thirty-six thousand times!” i interrupted. “but where\\ndid their ‘method’ break down?”\\n\\n“_mon ami_, it is a good plan to take a place as chambermaid or\\nvalet—but you must not shirk your work. they left an empty room\\nundusted; and therefore, when the man put down the jewel-case on\\nthe little table near the communicating door, it left a square\\nmark——”\\n\\n“i remember,” i cried.\\n\\n“before, i was undecided. then—i _knew_!” there was a moment’s\\nsilence.\\n\\n“and i’ve got my pearls,” said mrs. opalsen as a sort of greek\\nchorus.\\n\\n“well,” i said, “i’d better have some dinner.” poirot accompanied\\nme.\\n\\n“this ought to mean kudos for you,” i observed.\\n\\n“_pas du tout_,” replied poirot tranquilly. “japp and the local\\ninspector will divide the credit between them. but”—he tapped his\\npocket—“i have a cheque here, from mr. opalsen, and, how say you,\\nmy friend? this week-end has not gone according to plan. shall we\\nreturn here next week-end—at my expense this time?”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  viii\\n\\n\\n  the kidnapped prime minister\\n\\n\\nnow that war and the problems of war are things of the past, i\\nthink i may safely venture to reveal to the world the part which\\nmy friend poirot played in a moment of national crisis. the secret\\nhas been well guarded. not a whisper of it reached the press. but,\\nnow that the need for secrecy has gone by, i feel it is only just\\nthat england should know the debt it owes to my quaint little\\nfriend, whose marvellous brain so ably averted a great catastrophe.\\n\\none evening after dinner—i will not particularize the date; it\\nsuffices to say that it was at the time when “peace by negotiation”\\nwas the parrot-cry of england’s enemies—my friend and i were\\nsitting in his rooms. after being invalided out of the army i had\\nbeen given a recruiting job, and it had become my custom to drop\\nin on poirot in the evenings after dinner and talk with him of any\\ncases of interest that he might have on hand.\\n\\ni was attempting to discuss with him the sensational news of that\\nday—no less than an attempted assassination of mr. david macadam,\\nengland’s prime minister. the account in the papers had evidently\\nbeen carefully censored. no details were given, save that the prime\\nminister had had a marvellous escape, the bullet just grazing his\\ncheek.\\n\\ni considered that our police must have been shamefully careless\\nfor such an outrage to be possible. i could well understand that\\nthe german agents in england would be willing to risk much for such\\nan achievement. “fighting mac,” as his own party had nicknamed him,\\nhad strenuously and unequivocally combated the pacifist influence\\nwhich was becoming so prevalent.\\n\\nhe was more than england’s prime minister—he _was_ england; and\\nto have removed him from his sphere of influence would have been\\na crushing and paralysing blow to britain.\\n\\npoirot was busy mopping a grey suit with a minute sponge. never\\nwas there a dandy such as hercule poirot. neatness and order were\\nhis passion. now, with the odour of benzine filling the air, he\\nwas quite unable to give me his full attention.\\n\\n“in a little minute i am with you, my friend. i have all but\\nfinished. the spot of grease—he is not good—i remove him—so!” he\\nwaved his sponge.\\n\\ni smiled as i lit another cigarette.\\n\\n“anything interesting on?” i inquired, after a minute or two.\\n\\n“i assist a—how do you call it?—‘charlady’ to find her husband. a\\ndifficult affair, needing the tact. for i have a little idea that\\nwhen he is found he will not be pleased. what would you? for my\\npart, i sympathize with him. he was a man of discrimination to lose\\nhimself.”\\n\\ni laughed.\\n\\n“at last! the spot of grease, he is gone! i am at your disposal.”\\n\\n“i was asking you what you thought of this attempt to assassinate\\nmacadam?”\\n\\n“_enfantillage!_” replied poirot promptly. “one can hardly take it\\nseriously. to fire with the rifle—never does it succeed. it is a\\ndevice of the past.”\\n\\n“it was very near succeeding this time,” i reminded him.\\n\\npoirot shook his head impatiently. he was about to reply when the\\nlandlady thrust her head round the door and informed him that there\\nwere two gentlemen below who wanted to see him.\\n\\n“they won’t give their names, sir, but they says as it’s very\\nimportant.”\\n\\n“let them mount,” said poirot, carefully folding his grey trousers.\\n\\nin a few minutes the two visitors were ushered in, and my heart\\ngave a leap as in the foremost i recognized no less a personage\\nthan lord estair, leader of the house of commons; whilst his\\ncompanion, mr. bernard dodge, was also a member of the war cabinet,\\nand, as i knew, a close personal friend of the prime minister.\\n\\n“monsieur poirot?” said lord estair interrogatively. my friend\\nbowed. the great man looked at me and hesitated. “my business is\\nprivate.”\\n\\n“you may speak freely before captain hastings,” said my friend,\\nnodding to me to remain. “he has not all the gifts, no! but i\\nanswer for his discretion.”\\n\\nlord estair still hesitated, but mr. dodge broke in abruptly:\\n\\n“oh, come on—don’t let’s beat about the bush! as far as i can see,\\nthe whole of england will know the hole we’re in soon enough.\\ntime’s everything.”\\n\\n“pray be seated, messieurs,” said poirot politely. “will you take\\nthe big chair, _milord_?”\\n\\nlord estair started slightly. “you know me?”\\n\\npoirot smiled. “certainly. i read the little papers with the\\npictures. how should i not know you?”\\n\\n“monsieur poirot, i have come to consult you upon a matter of the\\nmost vital urgency. i must ask for absolute secrecy.”\\n\\n“you have the word of hercule poirot—i can say no more!” said my\\nfriend grandiloquently.\\n\\n“it concerns the prime minister. we are in grave trouble.”\\n\\n“we’re up a tree!” interposed mr. dodge.\\n\\n“the injury is serious, then?” i asked.\\n\\n“what injury?”\\n\\n“the bullet wound.”\\n\\n“oh, that!” cried mr. dodge contemptuously. “that’s old history.”\\n\\n“as my colleague says,” continued lord estair, “that affair is over\\nand done with. luckily, it failed. i wished i could say as much\\nfor the second attempt.”\\n\\n“there has been a second attempt, then?”\\n\\n“yes, though not of the same nature. monsieur poirot, the prime\\nminister has disappeared.”\\n\\n“what?”\\n\\n“he has been kidnapped!”\\n\\n“impossible!” i cried, stupefied.\\n\\npoirot threw a withering glance at me, which i knew enjoined me to\\nkeep my mouth shut.\\n\\n“unfortunately, impossible as it seems, it is only too true,”\\ncontinued his lordship.\\n\\npoirot looked at mr. dodge. “you said just now, monsieur, that time\\nwas everything. what did you mean by that?”\\n\\nthe two men exchanged glances, and then lord estair said:\\n\\n“you have heard, monsieur poirot, of the approaching allied\\nconference?”\\n\\nmy friend nodded.\\n\\n“for obvious reasons, no details have been given of when and where\\nit is to take place. but, although it has been kept out of the\\nnewspapers, the date is, of course, widely known in diplomatic\\ncircles. the conference is to be held to-morrow—thursday—evening\\nat versailles. now you perceive the terrible gravity of the\\nsituation. i will not conceal from you that the prime minister’s\\npresence at the conference is a vital necessity. the pacifist\\npropaganda, started and maintained by the german agents in our\\nmidst, has been very active. it is the universal opinion that the\\nturning point of the conference will be the strong personality of\\nthe prime minister. his absence may have the most serious\\nresults—possibly a premature and disastrous peace. and we have no\\none who can be sent in his place. he alone can represent england.”\\n\\npoirot’s face had grown very grave. “then you regard the kidnapping\\nof the prime minister as a direct attempt to prevent his being\\npresent at the conference?”\\n\\n“most certainly i do. he was actually on his way to france at the\\ntime.”\\n\\n“and the conference is to be held?”\\n\\n“at nine o’clock to-morrow night.”\\n\\npoirot drew an enormous watch from his pocket.\\n\\n“it is now a quarter to nine.”\\n\\n“twenty-four hours,” said mr. dodge thoughtfully.\\n\\n“and a quarter,” amended poirot. “do not forget the quarter,\\nmonsieur—it may come in useful. now for the details—the abduction,\\ndid it take place in england or in france?”\\n\\n“in france. mr. macadam crossed to france this morning. he was to\\nstay to-night as the guest of the commander-in-chief, proceeding\\nto-morrow to paris. he was conveyed across the channel by destroyer.\\nat boulogne he was met by a car from general headquarters and one\\nof the commander-in-chief’s a.d.c.s.”\\n\\n“_eh bien_?”\\n\\n“well, they started from boulogne—but they never arrived.”\\n\\n“what?”\\n\\n“monsieur poirot, it was a bogus car and a bogus a.d.c. the real\\ncar was found in a side road, with the chauffeur and the a.d.c.\\nneatly gagged and bound.”\\n\\n“and the bogus car?”\\n\\n“is still at large.”\\n\\npoirot made a gesture of impatience. “incredible! surely it cannot\\nescape attention for long?”\\n\\n“so we thought. it seemed merely a question of searching thoroughly.\\nthat part of france is under military law. we were convinced that\\nthe car could not go long unnoticed. the french police and our own\\nscotland yard men, and the military are straining every nerve. it\\nis, as you say, incredible—but nothing has been discovered!”\\n\\nat that moment a tap came at the door, and a young officer entered\\nwith a heavily sealed envelope which he handed to lord estair.\\n\\n“just through from france, sir. i brought it on here, as you\\ndirected.”\\n\\nthe minister tore it open eagerly, and uttered an exclamation. the\\nofficer withdrew.\\n\\n“here is news at last! this telegram has just been decoded. they\\nhave found the second car, also the secretary, daniels, chloroformed,\\ngagged, and bound, in an abandoned farm near c——. he remembers\\nnothing, except something being pressed against his mouth and nose\\nfrom behind, and struggling to free himself. the police are\\nsatisfied as to the genuineness of his statement.”\\n\\n“and they have found nothing else?”\\n\\n“no.”\\n\\n“not the prime minister’s dead body? then, there is hope. but it\\nis strange. why, after trying to shoot him this morning, are they\\nnow taking so much trouble to keep him alive?”\\n\\ndodge shook his head. “one thing’s quite certain. they’re determined\\nat all costs to prevent his attending the conference.”\\n\\n“if it is humanly possible, the prime minister shall be there. god\\ngrant it is not too late. now, messieurs, recount to me\\neverything—from the beginning. i must know about this shooting\\naffair as well.”\\n\\n“last night, the prime minister, accompanied by one of his\\nsecretaries, captain daniels——”\\n\\n“the same who accompanied him to france?”\\n\\n“yes. as i was saying, they motored down to windsor, where the\\nprime minister was granted an audience. early this morning, he\\nreturned to town, and it was on the way that the attempted\\nassassination took place.”\\n\\n“one moment, if you please. who is this captain daniels? you have\\nhis dossier?”\\n\\nlord estair smiled. “i thought you would ask me that. we do not\\nknow very much of him. he is of no particular family. he has served\\nin the english army, and is an extremely able secretary, being an\\nexceptionally fine linguist. i believe he speaks seven languages.\\nit is for that reason that the prime minister chose him to accompany\\nhim to france.”\\n\\n“has he any relatives in england?”\\n\\n“two aunts. a mrs. everard, who lives at hampstead, and a miss\\ndaniels, who lives near ascot.”\\n\\n“ascot? that is near to windsor, is it not?”\\n\\n“that point has not been overlooked. but it has led to nothing.”\\n\\n“you regard the capitaine daniels, then, as above suspicion?”\\n\\na shade of bitterness crept into lord estair’s voice, as he replied:\\n\\n“no, monsieur poirot. in these days, i should hesitate before i\\npronounced _anyone_ above suspicion.”\\n\\n“_très bien_. now i understand, _milord_, that the prime minister\\nwould, as a matter of course, be under vigilant police protection,\\nwhich ought to render any assault upon him an impossibility?”\\n\\nlord estair bowed his head. “that is so. the prime minister’s car\\nwas closely followed by another car containing detectives in plain\\nclothes. mr. macadam knew nothing of these precautions. he is\\npersonally a most fearless man, and would be inclined to sweep them\\naway arbitrarily. but, naturally, the police make their own\\narrangements. in fact, the premier’s chauffeur, o’murphy, is a\\nc.i.d. man.”\\n\\n“o’murphy? that is a name of ireland, is it not so?”\\n\\n“yes, he is an irishman.”\\n\\n“from what part of ireland?”\\n\\n“county clare, i believe.”\\n\\n“_tiens!_ but proceed, _milord_.”\\n\\n“the premier started for london. the car was a closed one. he and\\ncaptain daniels sat inside. the second car followed as usual. but,\\nunluckily, for some unknown reason, the prime minister’s car\\ndeviated from the main road——”\\n\\n“at a point where the road curves?” interrupted poirot.\\n\\n“yes—but how did you know?”\\n\\n“oh, _c’est évident_! continue!”\\n\\n“for some unknown reason,” continued lord estair, “the premier’s\\ncar left the main road. the police car, unaware of the deviation,\\ncontinued to keep to the high road. at a short distance down the\\nunfrequented lane, the prime minister’s car was suddenly held up\\nby a band of masked men. the chauffeur——”\\n\\n“that brave o’murphy!” murmured poirot thoughtfully.\\n\\n“the chauffeur, momentarily taken aback, jammed on the brakes. the\\nprime minister put his head out of the window. instantly a shot\\nrang out—then another. the first one grazed his cheek, the second,\\nfortunately, went wide. the chauffeur, now realizing the danger,\\ninstantly forged straight ahead, scattering the band of men.”\\n\\n“a near escape,” i ejaculated, with a shiver.\\n\\n“mr. macadam refused to make any fuss over the slight wound he had\\nreceived. he declared it was only a scratch. he stopped at a local\\ncottage hospital, where it was dressed and bound up—he did not, of\\ncourse, reveal his identity. he then drove, as per schedule,\\nstraight to charing cross, where a special train for dover was\\nawaiting him, and, after a brief account of what had happened had\\nbeen given to the anxious police by captain daniels, he duly\\ndeparted for france. at dover, he went on board the waiting\\ndestroyer. at boulogne, as you know, the bogus car was waiting for\\nhim, carrying the union jack, and correct in every detail.”\\n\\n“that is all you have to tell me?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“there is no other circumstance that you have omitted, milord?”\\n\\n“well, there is one rather peculiar thing.”\\n\\n“yes?”\\n\\n“the prime minister’s car did not return home after leaving the\\nprime minister at charing cross. the police were anxious to\\ninterview o’murphy, so a search was instituted at once. the car\\nwas discovered standing outside a certain unsavoury little\\nrestaurant in soho, which is well known as a meeting-place of\\ngerman agents.”\\n\\n“and the chauffeur?”\\n\\n“the chauffeur was nowhere to be found. he, too, had disappeared.”\\n\\n“so,” said poirot thoughtfully, “there are two disappearances: the\\nprime minister in france, and o’murphy in london.”\\n\\nhe looked keenly at lord estair, who made a gesture of despair.\\n\\n“i can only tell you, monsieur poirot, that, if anyone had suggested\\nto me yesterday that o’murphy was a traitor, i should have laughed\\nin his face.”\\n\\n“and to-day?”\\n\\n“to-day i do not know what to think.”\\n\\npoirot nodded gravely. he looked at his turnip of a watch again.\\n\\n“i understand that i have carte blanche, messieurs—in every way,\\ni mean? i must be able to go where i choose, and how i choose.”\\n\\n“perfectly. there is a special train leaving for dover in an hour’s\\ntime, with a further contingent from scotland yard. you shall be\\naccompanied by a military officer and a c.i.d. man, who will hold\\nthemselves at your disposal in every way. is that satisfactory?”\\n\\n“quite. one more question before you leave, messieurs. what made\\nyou come to me? i am unknown, obscure, in this great london of\\nyours.”\\n\\n“we sought you out on the express recommendation and wish of a very\\ngreat man of your own country.”\\n\\n“_comment?_ my old friend the _préfet_——?”\\n\\nlord estair shook his head.\\n\\n“one higher than the _préfet_. one whose word was once law in\\nbelgium—and shall be again! that england has sworn!”\\n\\npoirot’s hand flew swiftly to a dramatic salute. “amen to that!\\nah, but my master does not forget. . . . messieurs, i, hercule\\npoirot, will serve you faithfully. heaven only send that it will\\nbe in time. but this is dark—dark. . . . i cannot see.”\\n\\n“well, poirot,” i cried impatiently, as the door closed behind the\\nministers, “what do you think?”\\n\\nmy friend was busy packing a minute suitcase, with quick, deft\\nmovements. he shook his head thoughtfully.\\n\\n“i do not know what to think. my brains desert me.”\\n\\n“why, as you said, kidnap him, when a knock on the head would do\\nas well?” i mused.\\n\\n“pardon me, _mon ami_, but i did not quite say that. it is\\nundoubtedly far more their affair to kidnap him.”\\n\\n“but why?”\\n\\n“because uncertainty creates panic. that is one reason. were the\\nprime minister dead, it would be a terrible calamity, but the\\nsituation would have to be faced. but now you have paralysis. will\\nthe prime minister reappear, or will he not? is he dead or alive?\\nnobody knows, and until they know nothing definite can be done.\\nand, as i tell you, uncertainty breeds panic, which is what _les\\nboches_ are playing for. then, again, if the kidnappers are holding\\nhim secretly somewhere, they have the advantage of being able to\\nmake terms with both sides. the german government is not a liberal\\npaymaster, as a rule, but no doubt they can be made to disgorge\\nsubstantial remittances in such a case as this. thirdly, they run\\nno risk of the hangman’s rope. oh, decidedly, kidnapping is their\\naffair.”\\n\\n“then, if that is so, why should they first try to shoot him?”\\n\\npoirot made a gesture of anger. “ah, that is just what i do not\\nunderstand! it is inexplicable—stupid! they have all their\\narrangements made (and very good arrangements too!) for the\\nabduction, and yet they imperil the whole affair by a melodramatic\\nattack, worthy of a cinema, and quite as unreal. it is almost\\nimpossible to believe in it, with its band of masked men, not\\ntwenty miles from london!”\\n\\n“perhaps they were two quite separate attempts which happened\\nirrespective of each other,” i suggested.\\n\\n“ah, no, that would be too much of a coincidence! then, further—who\\nis the traitor? there must have been a traitor—in the first affair,\\nanyway. but who was it—daniels or o’murphy? it must have been one\\nof the two, or why did the car leave the main road? we cannot\\nsuppose that the prime minister connived at his own assassination!\\ndid o’murphy take that turning of his own accord, or was it daniels\\nwho told him to do so?”\\n\\n“surely it must have been o’murphy’s doing.”\\n\\n“yes, because if it was daniels’ the prime minister would have\\nheard the order, and would have asked the reason. but there are\\naltogether too many ‘whys’ in this affair, and they contradict each\\nother. if o’murphy is an honest man, _why_ did he leave the main\\nroad? but if he was a dishonest man, _why_ did he start the car\\nagain when only two shots had been fired—thereby, in all probability,\\nsaving the prime minister’s life? and, again, if he was honest,\\nwhy did he, immediately on leaving charing cross, drive to a\\nwell-known rendezvous of german spies?”\\n\\n“it looks bad,” i said.\\n\\n“let us look at the case with method. what have we for and against\\nthese two men? take o’murphy first. against: that his conduct in\\nleaving the main road was suspicious; that he is an irishman from\\ncounty clare; that he has disappeared in a highly suggestive\\nmanner. for: that his promptness in restarting the car saved the\\npremier’s life; that he is a scotland yard man, and, obviously,\\nfrom the post allotted to him, a trusted detective. now for daniels.\\nthere is not much against him, except the fact that nothing is\\nknown of his antecedents, and that he speaks too many languages\\nfor a good englishman! (pardon me, _mon ami_, but, as linguists,\\nyou are deplorable!) _now for him_, we have the fact that he was\\nfound gagged, bound, and chloroformed—which does not look as though\\nhe had anything to do with the matter.”\\n\\n“he might have gagged and bound himself, to divert suspicion.”\\n\\npoirot shook his head. “the french police would make no mistake of\\nthat kind. besides, once he had attained his object, and the prime\\nminister was safely abducted, there would not be much point in his\\nremaining behind. his accomplices _could_ have gagged and\\nchloroformed him, of course, but i fail to see what object they\\nhoped to accomplish by it. he can be of little use to them now,\\nfor, until the circumstances concerning the prime minister have\\nbeen cleared up, he is bound to be closely watched.”\\n\\n“perhaps he hoped to start the police on a false scent?”\\n\\n“then why did he not do so? he merely says that something was\\npressed over his nose and mouth, and that he remembers nothing\\nmore. there is no false scent there. it sounds remarkably like the\\ntruth.”\\n\\n“well,” i said, glancing at the clock, “i suppose we’d better start\\nfor the station. you may find more clues in france.”\\n\\n“possibly, _mon ami_, but i doubt it. it is still incredible to me\\nthat the prime minister has not been discovered in that limited\\narea, where the difficulty of concealing him must be tremendous.\\nif the military and the police of two countries have not found him,\\nhow shall i?”\\n\\nat charing cross we were met by mr. dodge.\\n\\n“this is detective barnes, of scotland yard, and major norman. they\\nwill hold themselves entirely at your disposal. good luck to you.\\nit’s a bad business, but i’ve not given up hope. must be off now.”\\nand the minister strode rapidly away.\\n\\nwe chatted in a desultory fashion with major norman. in the centre\\nof the little group of men on the platform i recognized a little\\nferret-faced fellow talking to a tall, fair man. he was an old\\nacquaintance of poirot’s—detective-inspector japp, supposed to be\\none of the smartest of scotland yard’s officers. he came over and\\ngreeted my friend cheerfully.\\n\\n“i heard you were on this job too. smart bit of work. so far\\nthey’ve got away with the goods all right. but i can’t believe they\\ncan keep him hidden long. our people are going through france with\\na toothcomb. so are the french. i can’t help feeling it’s only a\\nmatter of hours now.”\\n\\n“that is, if he’s still alive,” remarked the tall detective\\ngloomily.\\n\\njapp’s face fell. “yes. . . . but somehow i’ve got the feeling he’s\\nalive all right.”\\n\\npoirot nodded. “yes, yes; he’s alive. but can he be found in time?\\ni, like you, did not believe he could be hidden so long.”\\n\\nthe whistle blew, and we all trooped up into the pullman car. then,\\nwith a slow, unwilling jerk, the train drew out of the station.\\n\\nit was a curious journey. the scotland yard men crowded together.\\nmaps of northern france were spread out, and eager forefingers\\ntraced the lines of roads and villages. each man had his own pet\\ntheory. poirot showed none of his usual loquacity, but sat staring\\nin front of him, with an expression on his face that reminded me\\nof a puzzled child. i talked to norman, whom i found quite an\\namusing fellow. on arriving at dover poirot’s behaviour moved me\\nto intense amusement. the little man, as he went on board the boat,\\nclutched desperately at my arm. the wind was blowing lustily.\\n\\n“_mon dieu!_” he murmured. “this is terrible!”\\n\\n“have courage, poirot,” i cried. “you will succeed. you will find\\nhim. i am sure of it.”\\n\\n“ah, _mon ami_, you mistake my emotion. it is this villainous sea\\nthat troubles me! the _mal de mer_—it is horrible suffering!”\\n\\n“oh!” i said, rather taken aback.\\n\\nthe first throb of the engines was felt, and poirot groaned and\\nclosed his eyes.\\n\\n“major norman has a map of northern france if you would like to\\nstudy it?”\\n\\npoirot shook his head impatiently.\\n\\n“but no, but no! leave me, my friend. see you, to think, the\\nstomach and the brain must be in harmony. laverguier has a method\\nmost excellent for averting the _mal de mer_. you breathe in—and\\nout—slowly, so—turning the head from left to right and counting\\nsix between each breath.”\\n\\ni left him to his gymnastic endeavours, and went on deck.\\n\\nas we came slowly into boulogne harbour poirot appeared, neat and\\nsmiling, and announced to me in a whisper that laverguier’s system\\nhad succeeded “to a marvel!”\\n\\njapp’s forefinger was still tracing imaginary routes on his map.\\n“nonsense! the car started from boulogne—here they branched off.\\nnow, my idea is that they transferred the prime minister to another\\ncar. see?”\\n\\n“well,” said the tall detective, “i shall make for the seaports.\\nten to one, they’ve smuggled him on board a ship.”\\n\\njapp shook his head. “too obvious. the order went out at once to\\nclose all the ports.”\\n\\nthe day was just breaking as we landed. major norman touched poirot\\non the arm. “there’s a military car here waiting for you, sir.”\\n\\n“thank you, monsieur. but, for the moment, i do not propose to\\nleave boulogne.”\\n\\n“what?”\\n\\n“no, we will enter this hotel here, by the quay.”\\n\\nhe suited the action to the word, demanded and was accorded a\\nprivate room. we three followed him, puzzled and uncomprehending.\\n\\nhe shot a quick glance at us. “it is not so that the good detective\\nshould act, eh? i perceive your thought. he must be full of energy.\\nhe must rush to and fro. he should prostrate himself on the dusty\\nroad and seek the marks of tyres through a little glass. he must\\ngather up the cigarette-end, the fallen match? that is your idea,\\nis it not?”\\n\\nhis eyes challenged us. “but i—hercule poirot—tell you that it is\\nnot so! the true clues are within—_here_!” he tapped his forehead.\\n“see you, i need not have left london. it would have been sufficient\\nfor me to sit quietly in my rooms there. all that matters is the\\nlittle grey cells within. secretly and silently they do their part,\\nuntil suddenly i call for a map, and i lay my finger on a\\nspot—so—and i say: the prime minister is _there_! and it is so!\\nwith method and logic one can accomplish anything! this frantic\\nrushing to france was a mistake—it is playing a child’s game of\\nhide-and-seek. but now, though it may be too late, i will set to\\nwork the right way, from within. silence, my friends, i beg of\\nyou.”\\n\\nand for five long hours the little man sat motionless, blinking\\nhis eyelids like a cat, his green eyes flickering and becoming\\nsteadily greener and greener. the scotland yard man was obviously\\ncontemptuous, major norman was bored and impatient, and i myself\\nfound the time pass with wearisome slowness.\\n\\nfinally, i got up, and strolled as noiselessly as i could to the\\nwindow. the matter was becoming a farce. i was secretly concerned\\nfor my friend. if he failed, i would have preferred him to fail in\\na less ridiculous manner. out of the window i idly watched the\\ndaily leave boat, belching forth columns of smoke, as she lay\\nalongside the quay.\\n\\nsuddenly i was aroused by poirot’s voice close to my elbow.\\n\\n“_mes amis_, let us start!”\\n\\ni turned. an extraordinary transformation had come over my friend.\\nhis eyes were flickering with excitement, his chest was swelled to\\nthe uttermost.\\n\\n“i have been an imbecile, my friends! but i see daylight at last.”\\n\\nmajor norman moved hastily to the door. “i’ll order the car.”\\n\\n“there is no need. i shall not use it. thank heaven the wind has\\nfallen.”\\n\\n“do you mean you are going to walk, sir?”\\n\\n“no, my young friend. i am no st. peter. i prefer to cross the sea\\nby boat.”\\n\\n“to cross the _sea_?”\\n\\n“yes. to work with method, one must begin from the beginning. and\\nthe beginning of this affair was in england. therefore, we return\\nto england.”\\n\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\n\\nat three o’clock, we stood once more upon charing cross platform.\\nto all our expostulations, poirot turned a deaf ear, and reiterated\\nagain and again that to start at the beginning was not a waste of\\ntime, but the only way. on the way over, he had conferred with\\nnorman in a low voice, and the latter had despatched a sheaf of\\ntelegrams from dover.\\n\\nowing to the special passes held by norman, we got through\\neverywhere in record time. in london, a large police car was\\nwaiting for us, with some plain-clothes men, one of whom handed a\\ntypewritten sheet of paper to my friend. he answered my inquiring\\nglance.\\n\\n“a list of the cottage hospitals within a certain radius west of\\nlondon. i wired for it from dover.”\\n\\nwe were whirled rapidly through the london streets. we were on the\\nbath road. on we went, through hammersmith, chiswick and brentford.\\ni began to see our objective. through windsor and on to ascot. my\\nheart gave a leap. ascot was where daniels had an aunt living. we\\nwere after _him_, then, not o’murphy.\\n\\nwe duly stopped at the gate of a trim villa. poirot jumped out and\\nrang the bell. i saw a perplexed frown dimming the radiance of his\\nface. plainly, he was not satisfied. the bell was answered. he was\\nushered inside. in a few moments he reappeared, and climbed into\\nthe car with a short, sharp shake of his head. my hopes began to\\ndie down. it was past four now. even if he found certain evidence\\nincriminating daniels, what would be the good of it, unless he\\ncould wring from some one the exact spot in france where they were\\nholding the prime minister?\\n\\nour return progress towards london was an interrupted one. we\\ndeviated from the main road more than once, and occasionally\\nstopped at a small building, which i had no difficulty in\\nrecognizing as a cottage hospital. poirot only spent a few minutes\\nat each, but at every halt his radiant assurance was more and more\\nrestored.\\n\\nhe whispered something to norman, to which the latter replied:\\n\\n“yes, if you turn off to the left, you will find them waiting by\\nthe bridge.”\\n\\nwe turned up a side road, and in the failing light i discerned a\\nsecond car, waiting by the side of the road. it contained two men\\nin plain clothes. poirot got down and spoke to them, and then we\\nstarted off in a northerly direction, the other car following close\\nbehind.\\n\\nwe drove for some time, our objective being obviously one of the\\nnorthern suburbs of london. finally, we drove up to the front door\\nof a tall house, standing a little back from the road in its own\\ngrounds.\\n\\nnorman and i were left with the car. poirot and one of the\\ndetectives went up to the door and rang. a neat parlourmaid opened\\nit. the detective spoke.\\n\\n“i am a police officer, and i have a warrant to search this house.”\\n\\nthe girl gave a little scream, and a tall, handsome woman of\\nmiddle-age appeared behind her in the hall.\\n\\n“shut the door, edith. they are burglars, i expect.”\\n\\nbut poirot swiftly inserted his foot in the door, and at the same\\nmoment blew a whistle. instantly the other detectives ran up, and\\npoured into the house, shutting the door behind them.\\n\\nnorman and i spent about five minutes cursing our forced inactivity.\\nfinally the door reopened, and the men emerged, escorting three\\nprisoners—a woman and two men. the woman, and one of the men, were\\ntaken to the second car. the other man was placed in our car by\\npoirot himself.\\n\\n“i must go with the others, my friend. but have great care of this\\ngentleman. you do not know him, no? _eh bien_, let me present to\\nyou, monsieur o’murphy!”\\n\\no’murphy! i _gaped_ at him open-mouthed as we started again. he\\nwas not handcuffed, but i did not fancy he would try to escape. he\\nsat there staring in front of him as though dazed. anyway, norman\\nand i would be more than a match for him.\\n\\nto my surprise, we still kept a northerly route. we were not\\nreturning to london, then! i was much puzzled. suddenly, as the\\ncar slowed down, i recognized that we were close to hendon\\naerodrome. immediately i grasped poirot’s idea. he proposed to\\nreach france by aeroplane.\\n\\nit was a sporting idea, but, on the face of it, impracticable. a\\ntelegram would be far quicker. time was everything. he must leave\\nthe personal glory of rescuing the prime minister to others.\\n\\nas we drew up, major norman jumped out, and a plain-clothes man\\ntook his place. he conferred with poirot for a few minutes, and\\nthen went off briskly.\\n\\ni, too, jumped out, and caught poirot by the arm.\\n\\n“i congratulate you, old fellow! they have told you the hiding-place?\\nbut, look here, you must wire to france at once. you’ll be too late\\nif you go yourself.”\\n\\npoirot looked at me curiously for a minute or two.\\n\\n“unfortunately, my friend, there are some things that cannot be\\nsent by telegram.”\\n\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\n\\nat that moment major norman returned, accompanied by a young\\nofficer in the uniform of the flying corps.\\n\\n“this is captain lyall, who will fly you over to france. he can\\nstart at once.”\\n\\n“wrap up warmly, sir,” said the young pilot. “i can lend you a\\ncoat, if you like.”\\n\\npoirot was consulting his enormous watch. he murmured to himself:\\n“yes, there is time—just time.” then he looked up, and bowed\\npolitely to the young officer. “i thank you, monsieur. but it is\\nnot i who am your passenger. it is this gentleman here.”\\n\\nhe moved a little aside as he spoke, and a figure came forward out\\nof the darkness. it was the second male prisoner who had gone in\\nthe other car, and as the light fell on his face, i gave a gasp of\\nsurprise.\\n\\n_it was the prime minister!_\\n\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\n\\n“for heaven’s sake, tell me all about it,” i cried impatiently, as\\npoirot, norman, and i motored back to london. “how in the world\\ndid they manage to smuggle him back to england?”\\n\\n“there was no need to smuggle him back,” replied poirot dryly. “the\\nprime minister has never left england. he was kidnapped on his way\\nfrom windsor to london.”\\n\\n“what?”\\n\\n“i will make all clear. the prime minister was in his car, his\\nsecretary beside him. suddenly a pad of chloroform is clapped on\\nhis face——”\\n\\n“but by whom?”\\n\\n“by the clever linguistic captain daniels. as soon as the prime\\nminister is unconscious, daniels picks up the speaking-tube, and\\ndirects o’murphy to turn to the right, which the chauffeur, quite\\nunsuspicious, does. a few yards down that unfrequented road, a\\nlarge car is standing, apparently broken down. its driver signals\\nto o’murphy to stop. o’murphy slows up. the stranger approaches.\\ndaniels leans out of the window, and, probably with the aid of an\\ninstantaneous anæsthetic, such as ethylchloride, the chloroform\\ntrick is repeated. in a few seconds, the two helpless men are\\ndragged out and transferred to the other car, and a pair of\\nsubstitutes take their places.”\\n\\n“impossible!”\\n\\n“_pas du tout!_ have you not seen music-hall turns imitating\\ncelebrities with marvellous accuracy? nothing is easier than to\\npersonate a public character. the prime minister of england is far\\neasier to understudy than mr. john smith of clapham, say. as for\\no’murphy’s ‘double,’ no one was going to take much notice of him\\nuntil after the departure of the prime minister, and by then he\\nwould have made himself scarce. he drives straight from charing\\ncross to the meeting-place of his friends. he goes in as o’murphy,\\nhe emerges as some one quite different. o’murphy has disappeared,\\nleaving a conveniently suspicious trail behind him.”\\n\\n“but the man who personated the prime minister was seen by every\\none!”\\n\\n“he was not seen by anyone who knew him privately or intimately.\\nand daniels shielded him from contact with anyone as much as\\npossible. moreover, his face was bandaged up, and anything unusual\\nin his manner would be put down to the fact that he was suffering\\nfrom shock as a result of the attempt upon his life. mr. macadam\\nhas a weak throat, and always spares his voice as much as possible\\nbefore any great speech. the deception was perfectly easy to keep\\nup as far as france. there it would be impracticable and\\nimpossible—so the prime minister disappears. the police of this\\ncountry hurry across the channel, and no one bothers to go into\\nthe details of the first attack. to sustain the illusion that the\\nabduction has taken place in france, daniels is gagged and\\nchloroformed in a convincing manner.”\\n\\n“and the man who has enacted the part of the prime minister?”\\n\\n“rids himself of his disguise. he and the bogus chauffeur may be\\narrested as suspicious characters, but no one will dream of\\nsuspecting their real part in the drama, and they will eventually\\nbe released for lack of evidence.”\\n\\n“and the real prime minister?”\\n\\n“he and o’murphy were driven straight to the house of ‘mrs.\\neverard,’ at hampstead, daniels’ so-called ‘aunt.’ in reality, she\\nis frau bertha ebenthal, and the police have been looking for her\\nfor some time. it is a valuable little present that i have made to\\nthem—to say nothing of daniels! ah, it was a clever plan, but he\\ndid not reckon on the cleverness of hercule poirot!”\\n\\ni think my friend might well be excused his moment of vanity.\\n\\n“when did you first begin to suspect the truth of the matter?”\\n\\n“when i began to work the right way—from _within_! i could not make\\nthat shooting affair fit in—but when i saw that the net result of\\nit was that _the prime minister went to france with his face bound\\nup_ i began to comprehend! and when i visited all the cottage\\nhospitals between windsor and london, and found that no one\\nanswering to my description had had his face bound up and dressed\\nthat morning, i was sure! after that, it was child’s-play for a\\nmind like mine!”\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\nthe following morning, poirot showed me a telegram he had just\\nreceived. it had no place of origin, and was unsigned. it ran:\\n\\n“in time.”\\n\\nlater in the day the evening papers published an account of the\\nallied conference. they laid particular stress on the magnificent\\novation accorded to mr. david macadam, whose inspiring speech had\\nproduced a deep and lasting impression.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  ix\\n\\n\\n  the disappearance of mr. davenheim\\n\\n\\npoirot and i were expecting our old friend inspector japp of\\nscotland yard to tea. we were sitting round the tea-table awaiting\\nhis arrival. poirot had just finished carefully straightening the\\ncups and saucers which our landlady was in the habit of throwing,\\nrather than placing, on the table. he had also breathed heavily on\\nthe metal teapot, and polished it with a silk handkerchief. the\\nkettle was on the boil, and a small enamel saucepan beside it\\ncontained some thick, sweet chocolate which was more to poirot’s\\npalate than what he described as “your english poison.” a sharp\\n“rat-tat” sounded below, and a few minutes afterwards japp entered\\nbriskly.\\n\\n“hope i’m not late,” he said as he greeted us. “to tell the truth,\\ni was yarning with miller, the man who’s in charge of the davenheim\\ncase.”\\n\\ni pricked up my ears. for the last three days the papers had been\\nfull of the strange disappearance of mr. davenheim, senior partner\\nof davenheim and salmon, the well-known bankers and financiers. on\\nsaturday last he had walked out of his house, and had never been\\nseen since. i looked forward to extracting some interesting details\\nfrom japp.\\n\\n“i should have thought,” i remarked, “that it would be almost\\nimpossible for anyone to ‘disappear’ nowadays.”\\n\\npoirot moved a plate of bread and butter the eighth of an inch,\\nand said sharply:\\n\\n“be exact, my friend. what do you mean by ‘disappear’? to which\\nclass of disappearance are you referring?”\\n\\n“are disappearances classified and labelled, then?” i laughed.\\n\\njapp smiled also. poirot frowned at us both.\\n\\n“but certainly they are! they fall into three categories: first,\\nand most common, the voluntary disappearance. second, the much\\nabused ‘loss of memory’ case—rare, but occasionally genuine. third,\\nmurder, and a more or less successful disposal of the body. do you\\nrefer to all three as impossible of execution?”\\n\\n“very nearly so, i should think. you might lose your own memory,\\nbut some one would be sure to recognize you—especially in the case\\nof a well-known man like davenheim. then ‘bodies’ can’t be made to\\nvanish into thin air. sooner or later they turn up, concealed in\\nlonely places, or in trunks. murder will out. in the same way, the\\nabsconding clerk, or the domestic defaulter, is bound to be run\\ndown in these days of wireless telegraphy. he can be headed off\\nfrom foreign countries; ports and railway stations are watched;\\nand, as for concealment in this country, his features and appearance\\nwill be known to every one who reads a daily newspaper. he’s up\\nagainst civilization.”\\n\\n“_mon ami_,” said poirot, “you make one error. you do not allow\\nfor the fact that a man who had decided to make away with another\\nman—or with himself in a figurative sense—might be that rare\\nmachine, a man of method. he might bring intelligence, talent, a\\ncareful calculation of detail to the task; and then i do not see\\nwhy he should not be successful in baffling the police force.”\\n\\n“but not _you_, i suppose?” said japp good-humouredly, winking at\\nme. “he couldn’t baffle _you_, eh, monsieur poirot?”\\n\\npoirot endeavoured, with a marked lack of success, to look modest.\\n“me, also! why not? it is true that i approach such problems with\\nan exact science, a mathematical precision, which seems, alas, only\\ntoo rare in the new generation of detectives!”\\n\\njapp grinned more widely.\\n\\n“i don’t know,” he said. “miller, the man who’s on this case, is\\na smart chap. you may be very sure he won’t overlook a footprint,\\nor a cigar-ash, or a crumb even. he’s got eyes that see everything.”\\n\\n“so, _mon ami_,” said poirot, “has the london sparrow. but all the\\nsame, i should not ask the little brown bird to solve the problem\\nof mr. davenheim.”\\n\\n“come now, monsieur, you’re not going to run down the value of\\ndetails as clues?”\\n\\n“by no means. these things are all good in their way. the danger\\nis they may assume undue importance. most details are insignificant;\\none or two are vital. it is the brain, the little grey cells”—he\\ntapped his forehead—“on which one must rely. the senses mislead.\\none must seek the truth within—not without.”\\n\\n“you don’t mean to say, monsieur poirot, that you would undertake\\nto solve a case without moving from your chair, do you?”\\n\\n“that is exactly what i do mean—granted the facts were placed\\nbefore me. i regard myself as a consulting specialist.”\\n\\njapp slapped his knee. “hanged if i don’t take you at your word.\\nbet you a fiver that you can’t lay your hand—or rather tell me\\nwhere to lay my hand—on mr. davenheim, dead or alive, before a week\\nis out.”\\n\\npoirot considered. “_eh bien, mon ami_, i accept. _le sport_, it\\nis the passion of you english. now—the facts.”\\n\\n“on saturday last, as is his usual custom, mr. davenheim took the\\n12.40 train from victoria to chingside, where his palatial country\\nplace, the cedars, is situated. after lunch, he strolled round the\\ngrounds, and gave various directions to the gardeners. everybody\\nagrees that his manner was absolutely normal and as usual. after\\ntea he put his head into his wife’s boudoir, saying that he was\\ngoing to stroll down to the village and post some letters. he added\\nthat he was expecting a mr. lowen, on business. if he should come\\nbefore he himself returned, he was to be shown into the study and\\nasked to wait. mr. davenheim then left the house by the front door,\\npassed leisurely down the drive, and out at the gate, and—was never\\nseen again. from that hour, he vanished completely.”\\n\\n“pretty—very pretty—altogether a charming little problem,” murmured\\npoirot. “proceed, my good friend.”\\n\\n“about a quarter of an hour later a tall, dark man with a thick\\nblack moustache rang the front-door bell, and explained that he\\nhad an appointment with mr. davenheim. he gave the name of lowen,\\nand in accordance with the banker’s instructions was shown into\\nthe study. nearly an hour passed. mr. davenheim did not return.\\nfinally mr. lowen rang the bell, and explained that he was unable\\nto wait any longer, as he must catch his train back to town. mrs.\\ndavenheim apologized for her husband’s absence, which seemed\\nunaccountable, as she knew him to have been expecting the visitor.\\nmr. lowen reiterated his regrets and took his departure.\\n\\n“well, as every one knows, mr. davenheim did not return. early on\\nsunday morning the police were communicated with, but could make\\nneither head nor tail of the matter. mr. davenheim seemed literally\\nto have vanished into thin air. he had not been to the post office;\\nnor had he been seen passing through the village. at the station\\nthey were positive he had not departed by any train. his own motor\\nhad not left the garage. if he had hired a car to meet him in some\\nlonely spot, it seems almost certain that by this time, in view of\\nthe large reward offered for information, the driver of it would\\nhave come forward to tell what he knew. true, there was a small\\nrace-meeting at entfield, five miles away, and if he had walked to\\nthat station he might have passed unnoticed in the crowd. but since\\nthen his photograph and a full description of him have been\\ncirculated in every newspaper, and nobody has been able to give\\nany news of him. we have, of course, received many letters from\\nall over england, but each clue, so far, has ended in disappointment.\\n\\n“on monday morning a further sensational discovery came to light.\\nbehind a portière in mr. davenheim’s study stands a safe, and that\\nsafe had been broken into and rifled. the windows were fastened\\nsecurely on the inside, which seems to put an ordinary burglary\\nout of court, unless, of course, an accomplice within the house\\nfastened them again afterwards. on the other hand, sunday having\\nintervened, and the household being in a state of chaos, it is\\nlikely that the burglary was committed on the saturday, and remained\\nundetected until monday.”\\n\\n“_précisément_,” said poirot dryly. “well, is he arrested, _ce\\npauvre m. lowen_?”\\n\\njapp grinned. “not yet. but he’s under pretty close supervision.”\\n\\npoirot nodded. “what was taken from the safe? have you any idea?”\\n\\n“we’ve been going into that with the junior partner of the firm\\nand mrs. davenheim. apparently there was a considerable amount in\\nbearer bonds, and a very large sum in notes, owing to some large\\ntransaction having been just carried through. there was also a\\nsmall fortune in jewellery. all mrs. davenheim’s jewels were kept\\nin the safe. the purchasing of them had become a passion with her\\nhusband of late years, and hardly a month passed that he did not\\nmake her a present of some rare and costly gem.”\\n\\n“altogether a good haul,” said poirot thoughtfully. “now, what\\nabout lowen? is it known what his business was with davenheim that\\nevening?”\\n\\n“well, the two men were apparently not on very good terms. lowen\\nis a speculator in quite a small way. nevertheless, he has been\\nable once or twice to score a _coup_ off davenheim in the market,\\nthough it seems they seldom or never actually met. it was a matter\\nconcerning some south american shares which led the banker to make\\nhis appointment.”\\n\\n“had davenheim interests in south america, then?”\\n\\n“i believe so. mrs. davenheim happened to mention that he spent\\nall last autumn in buenos ayres.”\\n\\n“any trouble in his home life? were the husband and wife on good\\nterms?”\\n\\n“i should say his domestic life was quite peaceful and uneventful.\\nmrs. davenheim is a pleasant, rather unintelligent woman. quite a\\nnonentity, i think.”\\n\\n“then we must not look for the solution of the mystery there. had\\nhe any enemies?”\\n\\n“he had plenty of financial rivals, and no doubt there are many\\npeople whom he has got the better of who bear him no particular\\ngood-will. but there was no one likely to make away with him—and,\\nif they had, where is the body?”\\n\\n“exactly. as hastings says, bodies have a habit of coming to light\\nwith fatal persistency.”\\n\\n“by the way, one of the gardeners says he saw a figure going round\\nto the side of the house toward the rose-garden. the long french\\nwindow of the study opens on to the rose-garden, and mr. davenheim\\nfrequently entered and left the house that way. but the man was a\\ngood way off, at work on some cucumber frames, and cannot even say\\nwhether it was the figure of his master or not. also, he cannot\\nfix the time with any accuracy. it must have been before six, as\\nthe gardeners cease work at that time.”\\n\\n“and mr. davenheim left the house?”\\n\\n“about half-past five or thereabouts.”\\n\\n“what lies beyond the rose-garden?”\\n\\n“a lake.”\\n\\n“with a boathouse?”\\n\\n“yes, a couple of punts are kept there. i suppose you’re thinking\\nof suicide, monsieur poirot? well, i don’t mind telling you that\\nmiller’s going down to-morrow expressly to see that piece of water\\ndragged. that’s the kind of man he is!”\\n\\npoirot smiled faintly, and turned to me. “hastings, i pray you,\\nhand me that copy of the _daily megaphone_. if i remember rightly,\\nthere is an unusually clear photograph there of the missing man.”\\n\\ni rose, and found the sheet required. poirot studied the features\\nattentively.\\n\\n“h’m!” he murmured. “wears his hair rather long and wavy, full\\nmoustache and pointed beard, bushy eyebrows. eyes dark?”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“hair and beard turning grey?”\\n\\nthe detective nodded. “well, monsieur poirot, what have you got to\\nsay to it all? clear as daylight, eh?”\\n\\n“on the contrary, most obscure.”\\n\\nthe scotland yard man looked pleased.\\n\\n“which gives me great hopes of solving it,” finished poirot\\nplacidly.\\n\\n“eh?”\\n\\n“i find it a good sign when a case is obscure. if a thing is clear\\nas daylight—_eh bien_, mistrust it! some one has made it so.”\\n\\njapp shook his head almost pityingly. “well, each to their fancy.\\nbut it’s not a bad thing to see your way clear ahead.”\\n\\n“i do not see,” murmured poirot. “i shut my eyes—and think.”\\n\\njapp sighed. “well, you’ve got a clear week to think in.”\\n\\n“and you will bring me any fresh developments that arise—the result\\nof the labours of the hard-working and lynx-eyed inspector miller,\\nfor instance?”\\n\\n“certainly. that’s in the bargain.”\\n\\n“seems a shame, doesn’t it?” said japp to me as i accompanied him\\nto the door. “like robbing a child!”\\n\\ni could not help agreeing with a smile. i was still smiling as i\\nre-entered the room.\\n\\n“_eh bien!_” said poirot immediately. “you make fun of papa poirot,\\nis it not so?” he shook his finger at me. “you do not trust his\\ngrey cells? ah, do not be confused! let us discuss this little\\nproblem—incomplete as yet, i admit, but already showing one or two\\npoints of interest.”\\n\\n“the lake!” i said significantly.\\n\\n“and even more than the lake, the boathouse!”\\n\\ni looked sidewise at poirot. he was smiling in his most inscrutable\\nfashion. i felt that, for the moment, it would be quite useless to\\nquestion him further.\\n\\nwe heard nothing of japp until the following evening, when he\\nwalked in about nine o’clock. i saw at once by his expression that\\nhe was bursting with news of some kind.\\n\\n“_eh bien_, my friend,” remarked poirot. “all goes well? but do\\nnot tell me that you have discovered the body of mr. davenheim in\\nyour lake, because i shall not believe you.”\\n\\n“we haven’t found the body, but we did find his _clothes_—the\\nidentical clothes he was wearing that day. what do you say to\\nthat?”\\n\\n“any other clothes missing from the house?”\\n\\n“no, his valet is quite positive on that point. the rest of his\\nwardrobe is intact. there’s more. we’ve arrested lowen. one of the\\nmaids, whose business it is to fasten the bedroom windows, declares\\nthat she saw lowen coming _towards_ the study through the\\nrose-garden about a quarter past six. that would be about ten\\nminutes before he left the house.”\\n\\n“what does he himself say to that?”\\n\\n“denied first of all that he had ever left the study. but the maid\\nwas positive, and he pretended afterwards that he had forgotten\\njust stepping out of the window to examine an unusual species of\\nrose. rather a weak story! and there’s fresh evidence against him\\ncome to light. mr. davenheim always wore a thick gold ring set with\\na solitaire diamond on the little finger of his right hand. well,\\nthat ring was pawned in london on saturday night by a man called\\nbilly kellett! he’s already known to the police—did three months\\nlast autumn for lifting an old gentleman’s watch. it seems he tried\\nto pawn the ring at no less than five different places, succeeded\\nat the last one, got gloriously drunk on the proceeds, assaulted\\na policeman, and was run in in consequence. i went to bow street\\nwith miller and saw him. he’s sober enough now, and i don’t mind\\nadmitting we pretty well frightened the life out of him, hinting\\nhe might be charged with murder. this is his yarn, and a very queer\\none it is.\\n\\n“he was at entfield races on saturday, though i dare say scarfpins\\nwas his line of business, rather than betting. anyway, he had a\\nbad day, and was down on his luck. he was tramping along the road\\nto chingside, and sat down in a ditch to rest just before he got\\ninto the village. a few minutes later he noticed a man coming along\\nthe road to the village, ‘dark-complexioned gent, with a big\\nmoustache, one of them city toffs,’ is his description of the man.\\n\\n“kellett was half concealed from the road by a heap of stones. just\\nbefore he got abreast of him, the man looked quickly up and down\\nthe road, and seeing it apparently deserted he took a small object\\nfrom his pocket and threw it over the hedge. then he went on\\ntowards the station. now, the object he had thrown over the hedge\\nhad fallen with a slight ‘chink’ which aroused the curiosity of\\nthe human derelict in the ditch. he investigated and, after a short\\nsearch, discovered the ring! that is kellett’s story. it’s only\\nfair to say that lowen denies it utterly, and of course the word\\nof a man like kellett can’t be relied upon in the slightest. it’s\\nwithin the bounds of possibility that he met davenheim in the lane\\nand robbed and murdered him.”\\n\\npoirot shook his head.\\n\\n“very improbable, _mon ami_. he had no means of disposing of the\\nbody. it would have been found by now. secondly, the open way in\\nwhich he pawned the ring makes it unlikely that he did murder to\\nget it. thirdly, your sneak-thief is rarely a murderer. fourthly,\\nas he has been in prison since saturday, it would be too much of\\na coincidence that he is able to give so accurate a description of\\nlowen.”\\n\\njapp nodded. “i don’t say you’re not right. but all the same, you\\nwon’t get a jury to take much note of a jailbird’s evidence. what\\nseems odd to me is that lowen couldn’t find a cleverer way of\\ndisposing of the ring.”\\n\\npoirot shrugged his shoulders. “well, after all, if it were found\\nin the neighbourhood, it might be argued that davenheim himself\\nhad dropped it.”\\n\\n“but why remove it from the body at all?” i cried.\\n\\n“there might be a reason for that,” said japp. “do you know that\\njust beyond the lake, a little gate leads out on to the hill, and\\nnot three minutes’ walk brings you to—what do you think?—a _lime\\nkiln_.”\\n\\n“good heavens!” i cried. “you mean that the lime which destroyed\\nthe body would be powerless to affect the metal of the ring?”\\n\\n“exactly.”\\n\\n“it seems to me,” i said, “that that explains everything. what a\\nhorrible crime!”\\n\\nby common consent we both turned and looked at poirot. he seemed\\nlost in reflection, his brow knitted, as though with some supreme\\nmental effort. i felt that at last his keen intellect was asserting\\nitself. what would his first words be? we were not long left in\\ndoubt. with a sigh, the tension of his attitude relaxed, and\\nturning to japp, he asked:\\n\\n“have you any idea, my friend, whether mr. and mrs. davenheim\\noccupied the same bedroom?”\\n\\nthe question seemed so ludicrously inappropriate that for a moment\\nwe both stared in silence. then japp burst into a laugh. “good\\nlord, monsieur poirot, i thought you were coming out with something\\nstartling. as to your question, i’m sure i don’t know.”\\n\\n“you could find out?” asked poirot with curious persistence.\\n\\n“oh, certainly—if you _really_ want to know.”\\n\\n“_merci, mon ami_. i should be obliged if you would make a point\\nof it.”\\n\\njapp stared at him a few minutes longer, but poirot seemed to have\\nforgotten us both. the detective shook his head sadly at me, and\\nmurmuring, “poor old fellow! war’s been too much for him!” gently\\nwithdrew from the room.\\n\\nas poirot still seemed sunk in a daydream, i took a sheet of paper,\\nand amused myself by scribbling notes upon it. my friend’s voice\\naroused me. he had come out of his reverie, and was looking brisk\\nand alert.\\n\\n“_que faites-vous là, mon ami?_”\\n\\n“i was jotting down what occurred to me as the main points of\\ninterest in this affair.”\\n\\n“you become methodical—at last!” said poirot approvingly.\\n\\ni concealed my pleasure. “shall i read them to you?”\\n\\n“by all means.”\\n\\ni cleared my throat.\\n\\n“‘one: all the evidence points to lowen having been the man who\\nforced the safe.\\n\\n“‘two: he had a grudge against davenheim.\\n\\n“‘three: he lied in his first statement that he had never left the\\nstudy.\\n\\n“‘four: if you accept billy kellett’s story as true, lowen is\\nunmistakably implicated.’”\\n\\ni paused. “well?” i asked, for i felt that i had put my finger on\\nall the vital facts.\\n\\npoirot looked at me pityingly, shaking his head very gently. “_mon\\npauvre ami!_ but it is that you have not the gift! the important\\ndetail, you appreciate him never! also, your reasoning is false.”\\n\\n“how?”\\n\\n“let me take your four points.\\n\\n“one: mr. lowen could not possibly know that he would have the\\nchance to open the safe. he came for a business interview. he could\\nnot know beforehand that mr. davenheim would be absent posting a\\nletter, and that he would consequently be alone in the study!”\\n\\n“he might have seized his opportunity,” i suggested.\\n\\n“and the tools? city gentlemen do not carry round housebreaker’s\\ntools on the off chance! and one could not cut into that safe with\\na penknife, _bien entendu_!”\\n\\n“well, what about number two?”\\n\\n“you say lowen had a grudge against mr. davenheim. what you mean\\nis that he had once or twice got the better of him. and presumably\\nthose transactions were entered into with the view of benefiting\\nhimself. in any case you do not as a rule bear a grudge against a\\nman you have got the better of—it is more likely to be the other\\nway about. whatever grudge there might have been would have been\\non mr. davenheim’s side.”\\n\\n“well, you can’t deny that he lied about never having left the\\nstudy?”\\n\\n“no. but he may have been frightened. remember, the missing man’s\\nclothes had just been discovered in the lake. of course, as usual,\\nhe would have done better to speak the truth.”\\n\\n“and the fourth point?”\\n\\n“i grant you that. if kellett’s story is true, lowen is undeniably\\nimplicated. that is what makes the affair so very interesting.”\\n\\n“then i did appreciate _one_ vital fact?”\\n\\n“perhaps—but you have entirely overlooked the two most important\\npoints, the ones which undoubtedly hold the clue to the whole\\nmatter.”\\n\\n“and pray, what are they?”\\n\\n“one, the passion which has grown upon mr. davenheim in the last\\nfew years for buying jewellery. two, his trip to buenos ayres last\\nautumn.”\\n\\n“poirot, you are joking!”\\n\\n“i am most serious. ah, sacred thunder, but i hope japp will not\\nforget my little commission.”\\n\\nbut the detective, entering into the spirit of the joke, had\\nremembered it so well that a telegram was handed to poirot about\\neleven o’clock the next day. at his request i opened it and read\\nit out:\\n\\n“‘husband and wife have occupied separate rooms since last winter.’”\\n\\n“aha!” cried poirot. “and now we are in mid june! all is solved!”\\n\\ni stared at him.\\n\\n“you have no moneys in the bank of davenheim and salmon, _mon\\nami_?”\\n\\n“no,” i said, wondering. “why?”\\n\\n“because i should advise you to withdraw it—before it is too\\nlate.”\\n\\n“why, what do you expect?”\\n\\n“i expect a big smash in a few days—perhaps sooner. which reminds\\nme, we will return the compliment of a _dépêche_ to japp. a pencil,\\ni pray you, and a form. _voilà!_ ‘advise you to withdraw any money\\ndeposited with firm in question.’ that will intrigue him, the good\\njapp! his eyes will open wide—wide! he will not comprehend in the\\nslightest—until to-morrow, or the next day!”\\n\\ni remained sceptical, but the morrow forced me to render tribute\\nto my friend’s remarkable powers. in every paper was a huge headline\\ntelling of the sensational failure of the davenheim bank. the\\ndisappearance of the famous financier took on a totally different\\naspect in the light of the revelation of the financial affairs of\\nthe bank.\\n\\nbefore we were half-way through breakfast, the door flew open and\\njapp rushed in. in his left hand was a paper; in his right was\\npoirot’s telegram, which he banged down on the table in front of\\nmy friend.\\n\\n“how did you know, monsieur poirot? how the blazes could you know?”\\n\\npoirot smiled placidly at him. “ah, _mon ami_, after your wire, it\\nwas a certainty! from the commencement, see you, it struck me that\\nthe safe burglary was somewhat remarkable. jewels, ready money,\\nbearer bonds—all so conveniently arranged for—whom? well, the good\\nmonsieur davenheim was of those who ‘look after number one’ as your\\nsaying goes! it seemed almost certain that it was arranged\\nfor—himself! then his passion of late years for buying jewellery!\\nhow simple! the funds he embezzled, he converted into jewels, very\\nlikely replacing them in turn with paste duplicates, and so he put\\naway in a safe place, under another name, a considerable fortune\\nto be enjoyed all in good time when every one has been thrown off\\nthe track. his arrangements completed, he makes an appointment with\\nmr. lowen (who has been imprudent enough in the past to cross the\\ngreat man once or twice), drills a hole in the safe, leaves orders\\nthat the guest is to be shown into the study, and walks out of the\\nhouse—where?” poirot stopped, and stretched out his hand for\\nanother boiled egg. he frowned. “it is really insupportable,” he\\nmurmured, “that every hen lays an egg of a different size! what\\nsymmetry can there be on the breakfast table? at least they should\\nsort them in dozens at the shop!”\\n\\n“never mind the eggs,” said japp impatiently. “let ’em lay ’em\\nsquare if they like. tell us where our customer went to when he\\nleft the cedars—that is, if you know!”\\n\\n“_eh bien_, he went to his hiding-place. ah, this monsieur\\ndavenheim, there may be some malformation in his grey cells, but\\nthey are of the first quality!”\\n\\n“do you know where he is hiding?”\\n\\n“certainly! it is most ingenious.”\\n\\n“for the lord’s sake, tell us, then!”\\n\\npoirot gently collected every fragment of shell from his plate,\\nplaced them in the egg-cup, and reversed the empty egg-shell on\\ntop of them. this little operation concluded, he smiled on the neat\\neffect, and then beamed affectionately on us both.\\n\\n“come, my friends, you are men of intelligence. ask yourselves the\\nquestion which i asked myself. ‘if i were this man, where should\\n_i_ hide?’ hastings, what do you say?”\\n\\n“well,” i said, “i’m rather inclined to think i’d not do a bolt at\\nall. i’d stay in london—in the heart of things, travel by tubes\\nand buses; ten to one i’d never be recognized. there’s safety in\\na crowd.”\\n\\npoirot turned inquiringly to japp.\\n\\n“i don’t agree. get clear away at once—that’s the only chance. i\\nwould have had plenty of time to prepare things beforehand. i’d\\nhave a yacht waiting, with steam up, and i’d be off to one of the\\nmost out-of-the-way corners of the world before the hue and cry\\nbegan!”\\n\\nwe both looked at poirot. “what do _you_ say, monsieur?”\\n\\nfor a moment he remained silent. then a very curious smile flitted\\nacross his face.\\n\\n“my friends, if _i_ were hiding from the police, do you know\\n_where_ i should hide? _in a prison!_”\\n\\n“_what?_”\\n\\n“you are seeking monsieur davenheim in order to put him in prison,\\nso you never dream of looking to see if he may not be already\\nthere!”\\n\\n“what do you mean?”\\n\\n“you tell me madame davenheim is not a very intelligent woman.\\nnevertheless i think that if you took her to bow street and\\nconfronted her with the man billy kellett, she would recognize him!\\nin spite of the fact that he has shaved his beard and moustache\\nand those bushy eyebrows, and has cropped his hair close. a woman\\nnearly always knows her husband, though the rest of the world may\\nbe deceived!”\\n\\n“billy kellett? but he’s known to the police!”\\n\\n“did i not tell you davenheim was a clever man? he prepared his\\nalibi long beforehand. he was not in buenos ayres last autumn—he\\nwas creating the character of billy kellett, ‘doing three months,’\\nso that the police should have no suspicions when the time came.\\nhe was playing, remember, for a large fortune, as well as liberty.\\nit was worth while doing the thing thoroughly. only——”\\n\\n“yes?”\\n\\n“_eh bien_, afterwards he had to wear a false beard and wig, had\\nto _make up as himself_ again, and to sleep with a false beard is\\nnot easy—it invites detection! he cannot risk continuing to share\\nthe chamber of madame his wife. you found out for me that for the\\nlast six months, or ever since his supposed return from buenos\\nayres, he and mrs. davenheim occupied separate rooms. then i was\\nsure! everything fitted in. the gardener who fancied he saw his\\nmaster going round to the side of the house was quite right. he\\nwent to the boathouse, donned his ‘tramp’ clothes, which you may\\nbe sure had been safely hidden from the eyes of his valet, dropped\\nthe others in the lake, and proceeded to carry out his plan by\\npawning the ring in an obvious manner, and then assaulting a\\npoliceman, getting himself safely into the haven of bow street,\\nwhere nobody would ever dream of looking for him!”\\n\\n“it’s impossible,” murmured japp.\\n\\n“ask madame,” said my friend, smiling.\\n\\nthe next day a registered letter lay beside poirot’s plate. he\\nopened it, and a five-pound note fluttered out. my friend’s brow\\npuckered.\\n\\n“_ah, sacré!_ but what shall i do with it? i have much remorse!\\n_ce pauvre japp_! ah, an idea! we will have a little dinner, we\\nthree! that consoles me. it was really too easy. i am ashamed. i,\\nwho would not rob a child—_mille tonnerres! mon ami_, what have\\nyou, that you laugh so heartily?”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  x\\n\\n\\n  the adventure of the italian nobleman\\n\\n\\npoirot and i had many friends and acquaintances of an informal\\nnature. amongst these was to be numbered dr. hawker, a near\\nneighbour of ours, and a member of the medical profession. it was\\nthe genial doctor’s habit to drop in sometimes of an evening and\\nhave a chat with poirot, of whose genius he was an ardent admirer.\\nthe doctor himself, frank and unsuspicious to the last degree,\\nadmired the talents so far removed from his own.\\n\\non one particular evening in early june, he arrived about half-past\\neight and settled down to a comfortable discussion on the cheery\\ntopic of the prevalence of arsenical poisoning in crimes. it must\\nhave been about a quarter of an hour later when the door of our\\nsitting-room flew open, and a distracted female precipitated\\nherself into the room.\\n\\n“oh, doctor, you’re wanted! such a terrible voice. it gave me a\\nturn, it did indeed.”\\n\\ni recognized in our new visitor dr. hawker’s housekeeper, miss\\nrider. the doctor was a bachelor, and lived in a gloomy old house\\na few streets away. the usually placid miss rider was now in a\\nstate bordering on incoherence.\\n\\n“what terrible voice? who is it, and what’s the trouble?”\\n\\n“it was the telephone, doctor. i answered it—and a voice spoke.\\n‘help,’ it said. ‘doctor—help. they’ve killed me!’ then it sort of\\ntailed away. ‘who’s speaking?’ i said. ‘who’s speaking?’ then i\\ngot a reply, just a whisper, it seemed, ‘foscatine’—something like\\nthat—‘regent’s court.’”\\n\\nthe doctor uttered an exclamation.\\n\\n“count foscatini. he has a flat in regent’s court. i must go at\\nonce. what can have happened?”\\n\\n“a patient of yours?” asked poirot.\\n\\n“i attended him for some slight ailment a few weeks ago. an italian,\\nbut he speaks english perfectly. well, i must wish you good night,\\nmonsieur poirot, unless——” he hesitated.\\n\\n“i perceive the thought in your mind,” said poirot, smiling. “i\\nshall be delighted to accompany you. hastings, run down and get\\nhold of a taxi.”\\n\\ntaxis always make themselves sought for when one is particularly\\npressed for time, but i captured one at last, and we were soon\\nbowling along in the direction of regent’s park. regent’s court\\nwas a new block of flats, situated just off st. john’s wood road.\\nthey had only recently been built, and contained the latest service\\ndevices.\\n\\nthere was no one in the hall. the doctor pressed the lift-bell\\nimpatiently, and when the lift arrived questioned the uniformed\\nattendant sharply.\\n\\n“flat ii. count foscatini. there’s been an accident there, i\\nunderstand.”\\n\\nthe man stared at him.\\n\\n“first i’ve heard of it. mr. graves—that’s count foscatini’s\\nman—went out about half an hour ago, and he said nothing.”\\n\\n“is the count alone in the flat?”\\n\\n“no, sir, he’s got two gentlemen dining with him.”\\n\\n“what are they like?” i asked eagerly.\\n\\nwe were in the lift now, ascending rapidly to the second floor, on\\nwhich flat ii was situated.\\n\\n“i didn’t see them myself, sir, but i understand that they were\\nforeign gentlemen.”\\n\\nhe pulled back the iron door, and we stepped out on the landing.\\nno. ii was opposite to us. the doctor rang the bell. there was no\\nreply, and we could hear no sound from within. the doctor rang\\nagain and again; we could hear the bell trilling within, but no\\nsign of life rewarded us.\\n\\n“this is getting serious,” muttered the doctor. he turned to the\\nlift attendant.\\n\\n“is there any pass-key to this door?”\\n\\n“there is one in the porter’s office downstairs.”\\n\\n“get it, then, and, look here, i think you’d better send for the\\npolice.”\\n\\npoirot approved with a nod of the head.\\n\\nthe man returned shortly; with him came the manager.\\n\\n“will you tell me, gentlemen, what is the meaning of all this?”\\n\\n“certainly. i received a telephone message from count foscatini\\nstating that he had been attacked and was dying. you can understand\\nthat we must lose no time—if we are not already too late.”\\n\\nthe manager produced the key without more ado, and we all entered\\nthe flat.\\n\\nwe passed first into a small square lounge hall. a door on the\\nright of it was half open. the manager indicated it with a nod.\\n\\n“the dining-room.”\\n\\ndr. hawker led the way. we followed close on his heels. as we\\nentered the room i gave a gasp. the round table in the centre bore\\nthe remains of a meal; three chairs were pushed back, as though\\ntheir occupants had just risen. in the corner, to the right of the\\nfire-place, was a big writing-table, and sitting at it was a man—or\\nwhat had been a man. his right hand still grasped the base of the\\ntelephone, but he had fallen forward, struck down by a terrific\\nblow on the head from behind. the weapon was not far to seek. a\\nmarble statuette stood where it had been hurriedly put down, the\\nbase of it stained with blood.\\n\\nthe doctor’s examination did not take a minute. “stone dead. must\\nhave been almost instantaneous. i wonder he even managed to\\ntelephone. it will be better not to move him until the police\\narrive.”\\n\\non the manager’s suggestion we searched the flat, but the result\\nwas a foregone conclusion. it was not likely that the murderers\\nwould be concealed there when all they had to do was to walk out.\\n\\nwe came back to the dining-room. poirot had not accompanied us in\\nour tour. i found him studying the centre table with close\\nattention. i joined him. it was a well-polished round mahogany\\ntable. a bowl of roses decorated the centre, and white lace mats\\nreposed on the gleaming surface. there was a dish of fruit, but\\nthe three dessert plates were untouched. there were three\\ncoffee-cups with remains of coffee in them—two black, one with\\nmilk. all three men had taken port, and the decanter, half-full,\\nstood before the centre plate. one of the men had smoked a cigar,\\nthe other two cigarettes. a tortoiseshell-and-silver box, holding\\ncigars and cigarettes, stood open upon the table.\\n\\ni enumerated all these facts to myself, but i was forced to admit\\nthat they did not shed any brilliant light on the situation. i\\nwondered what poirot saw in them to make him so intent. i asked\\nhim.\\n\\n“_mon ami_,” he replied, “you miss the point. i am looking for\\nsomething that i do _not_ see.”\\n\\n“what is that?”\\n\\n“a mistake—even a little mistake—on the part of the murderer.”\\n\\nhe stepped swiftly to the small adjoining kitchen, looked in, and\\nshook his head.\\n\\n“monsieur,” he said to the manager, “explain to me, i pray, your\\nsystem of serving meals here.”\\n\\nthe manager stepped to a small hatch in the wall.\\n\\n“this is the service lift,” he explained. “it runs to the kitchens\\nat the top of the building. you order through this telephone, and\\nthe dishes are sent down in the lift, one course at a time. the\\ndirty plates and dishes are sent up in the same manner. no domestic\\nworries, you understand, and at the same time you avoid the wearying\\npublicity of always dining in a restaurant.”\\n\\npoirot nodded.\\n\\n“then the plates and dishes that were used to-night are on high in\\nthe kitchen. you permit that i mount there?”\\n\\n“oh, certainly, if you like! roberts, the lift man, will take you\\nup and introduce you; but i’m afraid you won’t find anything that’s\\nof any use. they’re handling hundreds of plates and dishes, and\\nthey’ll be all lumped together.”\\n\\npoirot remained firm, however, and together we visited the kitchens\\nand questioned the man who had taken the order from flat ii.\\n\\n“the order was given from the _à la carte menu_—for three,” he\\nexplained. “soup julienne, filet de sole normande, tournedos of\\nbeef, and a rice soufflé. what time? just about eight o’clock, i\\nshould say. no, i’m afraid the plates and dishes have been all\\nwashed up by now. unfortunate. you were thinking of finger-prints,\\ni suppose?”\\n\\n“not exactly,” said poirot, with an enigmatical smile. “i am more\\ninterested in count foscatini’s appetite. did he partake of every\\ndish?”\\n\\n“yes; but of course i can’t say how much of each he ate. the plates\\nwere all soiled, and the dishes empty—that is to say, with the\\nexception of the rice soufflé. there was a fair amount of that\\nleft.”\\n\\n“ah!” said poirot, and seemed satisfied with the fact.\\n\\nas we descended to the flat again he remarked in a low tone:\\n\\n“we have decidedly to do with a man of method.”\\n\\n“do you mean the murderer, or count foscatini?”\\n\\n“the latter was undoubtedly an orderly gentleman. after imploring\\nhelp and announcing his approaching demise, he carefully hung up\\nthe telephone receiver.”\\n\\ni stared at poirot. his words now and his recent inquiries gave me\\nthe glimmering of an idea.\\n\\n“you suspect poison?” i breathed. “the blow on the head was a\\nblind.”\\n\\npoirot merely smiled.\\n\\nwe re-entered the flat to find the local inspector of police had\\narrived with two constables. he was inclined to resent our\\nappearance, but poirot calmed him with the mention of our scotland\\nyard friend, inspector japp, and we were accorded a grudging\\npermission to remain. it was a lucky thing we were, for we had not\\nbeen back five minutes before an agitated middle-aged man came\\nrushing into the room with every appearance of grief and agitation.\\n\\nthis was graves, valet-butler to the late count foscatini. the\\nstory he had to tell was a sensational one.\\n\\non the previous morning, two gentlemen had called to see his\\nmaster. they were italians, and the elder of the two, a man of\\nabout forty, gave his name as signor ascanio. the younger was a\\nwell-dressed lad of about twenty-four.\\n\\ncount foscatini was evidently prepared for their visit and\\nimmediately sent graves out upon some trivial errand. here the man\\npaused and hesitated in his story. in the end, however, he admitted\\nthat, curious as to the purport of the interview, he had not obeyed\\nimmediately, but had lingered about endeavouring to hear something\\nof what was going on.\\n\\nthe conversation was carried on in so low a tone that he was not\\nas successful as he had hoped; but he gathered enough to make it\\nclear that some kind of monetary proposition was being discussed,\\nand that the basis of it was a threat. the discussion was anything\\nbut amicable. in the end, count foscatini raised his voice slightly,\\nand the listener heard these words clearly:\\n\\n“i have no time to argue further now, gentlemen. if you will dine\\nwith me to-morrow night at eight o’clock, we will resume the\\ndiscussion.”\\n\\nafraid of being discovered listening, graves had then hurried out\\nto do his master’s errand. this evening the two men had arrived\\npunctually at eight. during dinner they had talked of indifferent\\nmatters—politics, the weather, and the theatrical world. when\\ngraves had placed the port upon the table and brought in the coffee\\nhis master told him that he might have the evening off.\\n\\n“was that a usual proceeding of his when he had guests?” asked the\\ninspector.\\n\\n“no, sir; it wasn’t. that’s what made me think it must be some\\nbusiness of a very unusual kind that he was going to discuss with\\nthese gentlemen.”\\n\\nthat finished graves’s story. he had gone out about 8.30, and,\\nmeeting a friend, had accompanied him to the metropolitan music\\nhall in edgware road.\\n\\nnobody had seen the two men leave, but the time of the murder was\\nfixed clearly enough at 8.47. a small clock on the writing-table\\nhad been swept off by foscatini’s arm, and had stopped at that\\nhour, which agreed with miss rider’s telephone summons.\\n\\nthe police surgeon had made his examination of the body, and it\\nwas now lying on the couch. i saw the face for the first time—the\\nolive complexion, the long nose, the luxuriant black moustache,\\nand the full red lips drawn back from the dazzlingly white teeth.\\nnot altogether a pleasant face.\\n\\n“well,” said the inspector, refastening his notebook. “the case\\nseems clear enough. the only difficulty will be to lay our hands\\non this signor ascanio. i suppose his address is not in the dead\\nman’s pocket-book by any chance?”\\n\\nas poirot had said, the late foscatini was an orderly man. neatly\\nwritten in small, precise handwriting was the inscription, “signor\\npaolo ascanio, grosvenor hotel.”\\n\\nthe inspector busied himself with the telephone, then turned to us\\nwith a grin.\\n\\n“just in time. our fine gentleman was off to catch the boat train\\nto the continong. well, gentlemen, that’s about all we can do here.\\nit’s a bad business, but straightforward enough. one of these\\nitalian vendetta things, as likely as not.”\\n\\nthus airily dismissed, we found our way downstairs. dr. hawker was\\nfull of excitement.\\n\\n“like the beginning of a novel, eh? real exciting stuff. wouldn’t\\nbelieve it if you read about it.”\\n\\npoirot did not speak. he was very thoughtful. all the evening he\\nhad hardly opened his lips.\\n\\n“what says the master detective, eh?” asked hawker, clapping him\\non the back. “nothing to work your grey cells over this time.”\\n\\n“you think not?”\\n\\n“what could there be?”\\n\\n“well, for example, there is the window.”\\n\\n“the window? but it was fastened. nobody could have got out or in\\nthat way. i noticed it specially.”\\n\\n“and why were you able to notice it?”\\n\\nthe doctor looked puzzled. poirot hastened to explain.\\n\\n“it is to the curtains i refer. they were not drawn. a little odd,\\nthat. and then there was the coffee. it was very black coffee.”\\n\\n“well, what of it?”\\n\\n“very black,” repeated poirot. “in conjunction with that let us\\nremember that very little of the rice soufflé was eaten, and we\\nget—what?”\\n\\n“moonshine,” laughed the doctor. “you’re pulling my leg.”\\n\\n“never do i pull the leg. hastings here knows that i am perfectly\\nserious.”\\n\\n“i don’t know what you are getting at, all the same,” i confessed.\\n“you don’t suspect the manservant, do you? he might have been in\\nwith the gang, and put some dope in the coffee. i suppose they’ll\\ntest his alibi?”\\n\\n“without doubt, my friend; but it is the alibi of signor ascanio\\nthat interests me.”\\n\\n“you think he has an alibi?”\\n\\n“that is just what worries me. i have no doubt that we shall soon\\nbe enlightened on that point.”\\n\\nthe _daily newsmonger_ enabled us to become conversant with\\nsucceeding events.\\n\\nsignor ascanio was arrested and charged with the murder of count\\nfoscatini. when arrested, he denied knowing the count, and declared\\nhe had never been near regent’s court either on the evening of the\\ncrime or on the previous morning. the younger man had disappeared\\nentirely. signor ascanio had arrived alone at the grosvenor hotel\\nfrom the continent two days before the murder. all efforts to trace\\nthe second man failed.\\n\\nascanio, however, was not sent for trial. no less a personage than\\nthe italian ambassador himself came forward and testified at the\\npolice-court proceedings that ascanio had been with him at the\\nembassy from eight till nine that evening. the prisoner was\\ndischarged. naturally, a lot of people thought that the crime was\\na political one, and was being deliberately hushed up.\\n\\npoirot had taken a keen interest in all these points. nevertheless,\\ni was somewhat surprised when he suddenly informed me one morning\\nthat he was expecting a visitor at eleven o’clock, and that that\\nvisitor was none other than ascanio himself.\\n\\n“he wishes to consult you?”\\n\\n“_du tout_, hastings. i wish to consult him.”\\n\\n“what about?”\\n\\n“the regent’s court murder.”\\n\\n“you are going to prove that he did it?”\\n\\n“a man cannot be tried twice for murder, hastings. endeavour to\\nhave the common sense. ah, that is our friend’s ring.”\\n\\na few minutes later signor ascanio was ushered in—a small, thin\\nman with a secretive and furtive glance in his eyes. he remained\\nstanding, darting suspicious glances from one to the other of us.\\n\\n“monsieur poirot?”\\n\\nmy little friend tapped himself gently on the chest.\\n\\n“be seated, signor. you received my note. i am determined to get\\nto the bottom of this mystery. in some small measure you can aid\\nme. let us commence. you—in company with a friend—visited the late\\ncount foscatini on the morning of tuesday the 9th——”\\n\\nthe italian made an angry gesture.\\n\\n“i did nothing of the sort. i have sworn in court——”\\n\\n“_précisément_—and i have a little idea that you have sworn\\nfalsely.”\\n\\n“you threaten me? bah! i have nothing to fear from you. i have been\\nacquitted.”\\n\\n“exactly; and as i am not an imbecile, it is not with the gallows\\ni threaten you—but with publicity. publicity! i see that you do\\nnot like the word. i had an idea that you would not. my little\\nideas, you know, they are very valuable to me. come, signor, your\\nonly chance is to be frank with me. i do not ask to know whose\\nindiscretions brought you to england. i know this much, you came\\nfor the especial purpose of seeing count foscatini.”\\n\\n“he was not a count,” growled the italian.\\n\\n“i have already noted the fact that his name does not appear in\\nthe _almanach de gotha_. never mind, the title of count is often\\nuseful in the profession of blackmailing.”\\n\\n“i suppose i might as well be frank. you seem to know a good deal.”\\n\\n“i have employed my grey cells to some advantage. come, signor\\nascanio, you visited the dead man on the tuesday morning—that is\\nso, is it not?”\\n\\n“yes; but i never went there on the following evening. there was\\nno need. i will tell you all. certain information concerning a man\\nof great position in italy had come into this scoundrel’s\\npossession. he demanded a big sum of money in return for the\\npapers. i came over to england to arrange the matter. i called upon\\nhim by appointment that morning. one of the young secretaries of\\nthe embassy was with me. the count was more reasonable than i had\\nhoped, although even then the sum of money i paid him was a huge\\none.”\\n\\n“pardon, how was it paid?”\\n\\n“in italian notes of comparatively small denomination. i paid over\\nthe money then and there. he handed me the incriminating papers.\\ni never saw him again.”\\n\\n“why did you not say all this when you were arrested?”\\n\\n“in my delicate position i was forced to deny any association with\\nthe man.”\\n\\n“and how do you account for the events of the evening, then?”\\n\\n“i can only think that some one must have deliberately impersonated\\nme. i understand that no money was found in the flat.”\\n\\npoirot looked at him and shook his head.\\n\\n“strange,” he murmured. “we all have the little grey cells. and so\\nfew of us know how to use them. good morning, signor ascanio. i\\nbelieve your story. it is very much as i had imagined. but i had\\nto make sure.”\\n\\nafter bowing his guest out, poirot returned to his arm-chair and\\nsmiled at me.\\n\\n“let us hear m. le capitaine hastings on the case?”\\n\\n“well, i suppose ascanio is right—somebody impersonated him.”\\n\\n“never, never will you use the brains the good god has given you.\\nrecall to yourself some words i uttered after leaving the flat that\\nnight. i referred to the window-curtains not being drawn. we are\\nin the month of june. it is still light at eight o’clock. the light\\nis failing by half-past. _ça vous dit quelque chose?_ i perceive\\na struggling impression that you will arrive some day. now let us\\ncontinue. the coffee was, as i said, very black. count foscatini’s\\nteeth were magnificently white. coffee stains the teeth. we reason\\nfrom that that count foscatini did not drink any coffee. yet there\\nwas coffee in all three cups. why should anyone pretend count\\nfoscatini had drunk coffee when he had not done so?”\\n\\ni shook my head, utterly bewildered.\\n\\n“come, i will help you. what evidence have we that ascanio and his\\nfriend, or two men posing as them, ever came to the flat that\\nnight? nobody saw them go in; nobody saw them go out. we have the\\nevidence of one man and of a host of inanimate objects.”\\n\\n“you mean?”\\n\\n“i mean knives and forks and plates and empty dishes. ah, but it\\nwas a clever idea! graves is a thief and a scoundrel, but what a\\nman of method! he overhears a portion of the conversation in the\\nmorning, enough to realize that ascanio will be in awkward position\\nto defend himself. the following evening, about eight o’clock, he\\ntells his master he is wanted at the telephone. foscatini sits\\ndown, stretches out his hand to the telephone, and from behind\\ngraves strikes him down with the marble figure. then quickly to\\nthe service telephone—dinner for three! it comes, he lays the\\ntable, dirties the plates, knives, and forks, etc. but he has to\\nget rid of the food too. not only is he a man of brain; he has a\\nresolute and capacious stomach! but after eating three tournedos,\\nthe rice soufflé is too much for him! he even smokes a cigar and\\ntwo cigarettes to carry out the illusion. ah, but it was\\nmagnificently thorough! then, having moved on the hands of the\\nclock to 8.47, he smashes it and stops it. the one thing he does\\nnot do is to draw the curtains. but if there had been a real dinner\\nparty the curtains would have been drawn as soon as the light began\\nto fail. then he hurries out, mentioning the guests to the lift\\nman in passing. he hurries to a telephone box, and as near as\\npossible to 8.47 rings up the doctor with his master’s dying cry.\\nso successful is his idea that no one ever inquires if a call was\\nput through from flat ii at that time.”\\n\\n“except hercule poirot, i suppose?” i said sarcastically.\\n\\n“not even hercule poirot,” said my friend, with a smile. “i am\\nabout to inquire now. i had to prove my point to you first. but\\nyou will see, i shall be right; and then japp, to whom i have\\nalready given a hint, will be able to arrest the respectable\\ngraves. i wonder how much of the money he has spent.”\\n\\npoirot _was_ right. he always is, confound him!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  xi\\n\\n\\n  the case of the missing will\\n\\n\\nthe problem presented to us by miss violet marsh made rather a\\npleasant change from our usual routine work. poirot had received\\na brisk and business-like note from the lady asking for an\\nappointment, and he had replied asking her to call upon him at\\neleven o’clock the following day.\\n\\nshe arrived punctually—a tall, handsome young woman, plainly but\\nneatly dressed, with an assured and business-like manner. clearly\\na young woman who meant to get on in the world. i am not a great\\nadmirer of the so-called new woman myself, and, in spite of her\\ngood looks, i was not particularly prepossessed in her favour.\\n\\n“my business is of a somewhat unusual nature, monsieur poirot,”\\nshe began, after she had accepted a chair. “i had better begin at\\nthe beginning and tell you the whole story.”\\n\\n“if you please, mademoiselle.”\\n\\n“i am an orphan. my father was one of two brothers, sons of a small\\nyeoman farmer in devonshire. the farm was a poor one, and the elder\\nbrother, andrew, emigrated to australia, where he did very well\\nindeed, and by means of successful speculation in land became a\\nvery rich man. the younger brother, roger (my father), had no\\nleanings towards the agricultural life. he managed to educate\\nhimself a little, and obtained a post as a clerk with a small firm.\\nhe married slightly above him; my mother was the daughter of a poor\\nartist. my father died when i was six years old. when i was\\nfourteen, my mother followed him to the grave. my only living\\nrelation then was my uncle andrew, who had recently returned from\\naustralia and bought a small place, crabtree manor, in his native\\ncounty. he was exceedingly kind to his brother’s orphan child, took\\nme to live with him, and treated me in every way as though i was\\nhis own daughter.\\n\\n“crabtree manor, in spite of its name, is really only an old\\nfarmhouse. farming was in my uncle’s blood, and he was intensely\\ninterested in various modern farming experiments. although kindness\\nitself to me, he had certain peculiar and deeply-rooted ideas as\\nto the up-bringing of women. himself a man of little or no\\neducation, though possessing remarkable shrewdness, he placed\\nlittle value on what he called ‘book knowledge.’ he was especially\\nopposed to the education of women. in his opinion, girls should\\nlearn practical housework and dairy-work, be useful about the home,\\nand have as little to do with book learning as possible. he proposed\\nto bring me up on these lines, to my bitter disappointment and\\nannoyance. i rebelled frankly. i knew that i possessed a good\\nbrain, and had absolutely no talent for domestic duties. my uncle\\nand i had many bitter arguments on the subject, for, though much\\nattached to each other, we were both self-willed. i was lucky\\nenough to win a scholarship, and up to a certain point was\\nsuccessful in getting my own way. the crisis arose when i resolved\\nto go to girton. i had a little money of my own, left me by my\\nmother, and i was quite determined to make the best use of the\\ngifts god had given me. i had one long, final argument with my\\nuncle. he put the facts plainly before me. he had no other\\nrelations, and he had intended me to be his sole heiress. as i have\\ntold you, he was a very rich man. if i persisted in these\\n‘new-fangled notions’ of mine, however, i need look for nothing\\nfrom him. i remained polite, but firm. i should always be deeply\\nattached to him, i told him, but i must lead my own life. we parted\\non that note. ‘you fancy your brains, my girl,’ were his last\\nwords. ‘i’ve no book learning, but, for all that, i’ll pit mine\\nagainst yours any day. we’ll see what we shall see.’\\n\\n“that was nine years ago. i have stayed with him for a week-end\\noccasionally, and our relations were perfectly amicable, though\\nhis views remained unaltered. he never referred to my having\\nmatriculated, nor to my b.sc. for the last three years his health\\nhad been failing, and a month ago he died.\\n\\n“i am now coming to the point of my visit. my uncle left a most\\nextraordinary will. by its terms, crabtree manor and its contents\\nare to be at my disposal for a year from his death—‘during which\\ntime my clever niece may prove her wits,’ the actual words run. at\\nthe end of that period, ‘my wits having proved better than hers,’\\nthe house and all my uncle’s large fortune pass to various\\ncharitable institutions.”\\n\\n“that is a little hard on you, mademoiselle, seeing that you were\\nmr. marsh’s only blood relation.”\\n\\n“i do not look on it in that way. uncle andrew warned me fairly,\\nand i chose my own path. since i would not fall in with his wishes,\\nhe was at perfect liberty to leave his money to whom he pleased.”\\n\\n“was the will drawn up by a lawyer?”\\n\\n“no; it was written on a printed will-form and witnessed by the\\nman and his wife who live in the house and do for my uncle.”\\n\\n“there might be a possibility of upsetting such a will?”\\n\\n“i would not even attempt to do such a thing.”\\n\\n“you regard it, then, as a sporting challenge on the part of your\\nuncle?”\\n\\n“that is exactly how i look upon it.”\\n\\n“it bears that interpretation, certainly,” said poirot thoughtfully.\\n“somewhere in this rambling old manor-house your uncle has concealed\\neither a sum of money in notes or possibly a second will, and has\\ngiven you a year in which to exercise your ingenuity to find it.”\\n\\n“exactly, monsieur poirot; and i am paying you the compliment of\\nassuming that your ingenuity will be greater than mine.”\\n\\n“eh, eh! but that is very charming of you. my grey cells are at\\nyour disposal. you have made no search yourself?”\\n\\n“only a cursory one; but i have too much respect for my uncle’s\\nundoubted abilities to fancy that the task will be an easy one.”\\n\\n“have you the will or a copy of it with you?”\\n\\nmiss marsh handed a document across the table. poirot ran through\\nit, nodding to himself.\\n\\n“made three years ago. dated march 25; and the time is given\\nalso—11 a.m.—that is very suggestive. it narrows the field of\\nsearch. assuredly it is another will we have to seek for. a will\\nmade even half-an-hour later would upset this. _eh bien_,\\nmademoiselle, it is a problem charming and ingenious that you have\\npresented to me here. i shall have all the pleasure in the world\\nin solving it for you. granted that your uncle was a man of ability,\\nhis grey cells cannot have been of the quality of hercule poirot’s!”\\n\\n(really, poirot’s vanity is blatant!)\\n\\n“fortunately, i have nothing of moment on hand at the minute.\\nhastings and i will go down to crabtree manor to-night. the man\\nand wife who attended on your uncle are still there, i presume?”\\n\\n“yes, their name is baker.”\\n\\n\\n  •   •   •   •   •   •   •\\n\\n\\nthe following morning saw us started on the hunt proper. we had\\narrived late the night before. mr. and mrs. baker, having received\\na telegram from miss marsh, were expecting us. they were a pleasant\\ncouple, the man gnarled and pink-cheeked, like a shrivelled pippin,\\nand his wife a woman of vast proportions and true devonshire calm.\\n\\ntired with our journey and the eight-mile drive from the station,\\nwe had retired at once to bed after a supper of roast chicken,\\napple pie, and devonshire cream. we had now disposed of an excellent\\nbreakfast, and were sitting in a small panelled room which had been\\nthe late mr. marsh’s study and living-room. a roll-top desk stuffed\\nwith papers, all neatly docketed, stood against the wall, and a\\nbig leather armchair showed plainly that it had been its owner’s\\nconstant resting-place. a big chintz-covered settee ran along the\\nopposite wall, and the deep low window seats were covered with the\\nsame faded chintz of an old-fashioned pattern.\\n\\n“_eh bien, mon ami_,” said poirot, lighting one of his tiny\\ncigarettes, “we must map out our plan of campaign. already i have\\nmade a rough survey of the house, but i am of opinion that any clue\\nwill be found in this room. we shall have to go through the\\ndocuments in the desk with meticulous care. naturally, i do not\\nexpect to find the will amongst them; but it is likely that some\\napparently innocent paper may conceal the clue to its hiding-place.\\nbut first we must have a little information. ring the bell, i pray\\nof you.”\\n\\ni did so. while we were waiting for it to be answered, poirot\\nwalked up and down, looking about him approvingly.\\n\\n“a man of method this mr. marsh. see how neatly the packets of\\npapers are docketed; then the key to each drawer has its ivory\\nlabel—so has the key of the china cabinet on the wall; and see\\nwith what precision the china within is arranged. it rejoices the\\nheart. nothing here offends the eye——”\\n\\nhe came to an abrupt pause, as his eye was caught by the key of\\nthe desk itself, to which a dirty envelope was affixed. poirot\\nfrowned at it and withdrew it from the lock. on it were scrawled\\nthe words: “key of roll top desk,” in a crabbed handwriting, quite\\nunlike the neat superscriptions on the other keys.\\n\\n“an alien note,” said poirot, frowning. “i could swear that here\\nwe have no longer the personality of mr. marsh. but who else has\\nbeen in the house? only miss marsh, and she, if i mistake not, is\\nalso a young lady of method and order.”\\n\\nbaker came in answer to the bell.\\n\\n“will you fetch madame your wife, and answer a few questions?”\\n\\nbaker departed, and in a few moments returned with mrs. baker,\\nwiping her hands on her apron and beaming all over her face.\\n\\nin a few clear words poirot set forth the object of his mission.\\nthe bakers were immediately sympathetic.\\n\\n“us don’t want to see miss violet done out of what’s hers,” declared\\nthe woman. “cruel hard ’twould be for hospitals to get it all.”\\n\\npoirot proceeded with his questions. yes, mr. and mrs. baker\\nremembered perfectly witnessing the will. baker had previously been\\nsent into the neighbouring town to get two printed will-forms.\\n\\n“two?” said poirot sharply.\\n\\n“yes, sir, for safety like, i suppose, in case he should spoil\\none—and sure enough, so he did do. us had signed one——”\\n\\n“what time of day was that?”\\n\\nbaker scratched his head, but his wife was quicker.\\n\\n“why, to be sure, i’d just put the milk on for the cocoa at eleven.\\ndon’t ee remember? it had all boiled over on the stove when us got\\nback to kitchen.”\\n\\n“and afterwards?”\\n\\n“’twould be about an hour later. us had to go in again. ‘i’ve made\\na mistake,’ says old master, ‘had to tear the whole thing up. i’ll\\ntrouble you to sign again,’ and us did. and afterwards master give\\nus a tidy sum of money each. ‘i’ve left you nothing in my will,’\\nsays he, ‘but each year i live you’ll have this to be a nest-egg\\nwhen i’m gone’; and sure enough, so he did.”\\n\\npoirot reflected.\\n\\n“after you had signed the second time, what did mr. marsh do? do\\nyou know?”\\n\\n“went out to the village to pay tradesmen’s books.”\\n\\nthat did not seem very promising. poirot tried another tack. he\\nheld out the key of the desk.\\n\\n“is that your master’s writing?”\\n\\ni may have imagined it, but i fancied that a moment or two elapsed\\nbefore baker replied: “yes, sir, it is.”\\n\\n“he’s lying,” i thought. “but why?”\\n\\n“has your master let the house?—have there been any strangers in\\nit during the last three years?”\\n\\n“no, sir.”\\n\\n“no visitors?”\\n\\n“only miss violet.”\\n\\n“no strangers of any kind been inside this room?”\\n\\n“no, sir.”\\n\\n“you forget the workmen, jim,” his wife reminded him.\\n\\n“workmen?” poirot wheeled round on her. “what workmen?”\\n\\nthe woman explained that about two years and a half ago workmen\\nhad been in the house to do certain repairs. she was quite vague\\nas to what the repairs were. her view seemed to be that the whole\\nthing was a fad of her master’s and quite unnecessary. part of the\\ntime the workmen had been in the study; but what they had done\\nthere she could not say, as her master had not let either of them\\ninto the room whilst the work was in progress. unfortunately, they\\ncould not remember the name of the firm employed, beyond the fact\\nthat it was a plymouth one.\\n\\n“we progress, hastings,” said poirot, rubbing his hands as the\\nbakers left the room. “clearly he made a second will and then had\\nworkmen from plymouth in to make a suitable hiding-place. instead\\nof wasting time taking up the floor and tapping the walls, we will\\ngo to plymouth.”\\n\\nwith a little trouble, we were able to get the information we\\nwanted. after one or two essays, we found the firm employed by mr.\\nmarsh.\\n\\ntheir employees had all been with them many years, and it was easy\\nto find the two men who had worked under mr. marsh’s orders. they\\nremembered the job perfectly. amongst various other minor jobs,\\nthey had taken up one of the bricks of the old-fashioned fireplace,\\nmade a cavity beneath, and so cut the brick that it was impossible\\nto see the join. by pressing on the second brick from the end, the\\nwhole thing was raised. it had been quite a complicated piece of\\nwork, and the old gentleman had been very fussy about it. our\\ninformant was a man called coghan, a big, gaunt man with a grizzled\\nmoustache. he seemed an intelligent fellow.\\n\\nwe returned to crabtree manor in high spirits, and, locking the\\nstudy door, proceeded to put our newly acquired knowledge into\\neffect. it was impossible to see any sign on the bricks, but when\\nwe pressed in the manner indicated, a deep cavity was at once\\ndisclosed.\\n\\neagerly poirot plunged in his hand. suddenly his face fell from\\ncomplacent elation to consternation. all he held was a charred\\nfragment of stiff paper. but for it, the cavity was empty.\\n\\n“_sacré!_” cried poirot angrily. “some one has been before us.”\\n\\nwe examined the scrap of paper anxiously. clearly it was a fragment\\nof what we sought. a portion of baker’s signature remained, but no\\nindication of what the terms of the will had been.\\n\\npoirot sat back on his heels. his expression would have been\\ncomical if we had not been so overcome.\\n\\n“i understand it not,” he growled. “who destroyed this? and what\\nwas their object?”\\n\\n“the bakers?” i suggested.\\n\\n“_pourquoi?_ neither will makes any provision for them, and they\\nare more likely to be kept on with miss marsh than if the place\\nbecame the property of a hospital. how could it be to anyone’s\\nadvantage to destroy the will? the hospitals benefit—yes; but one\\ncannot suspect institutions.”\\n\\n“perhaps the old man changed his mind and destroyed it himself,”\\ni suggested.\\n\\npoirot rose to his feet, dusting his knees with his usual care.\\n\\n“that may be,” he admitted. “one of your more sensible observations,\\nhastings. well, we can do no more here. we have done all that\\nmortal man can do. we have successfully pitted our wits against\\nthe late andrew marsh’s; but, unfortunately, his niece is no better\\noff for our success.”\\n\\nby driving to the station at once, we were just able to catch a\\ntrain to london, though not the principal express. poirot was sad\\nand dissatisfied. for my part, i was tired and dozed in a corner.\\nsuddenly, as we were just moving out of taunton, poirot uttered a\\npiercing squeal.\\n\\n“_vite_, hastings! awake and jump! but jump i say!”\\n\\nbefore i knew where i was we were standing on the platform,\\nbareheaded and minus our valises, whilst the train disappeared into\\nthe night. i was furious. but poirot paid no attention.\\n\\n“imbecile that i have been!” he cried. “triple imbecile! not again\\nwill i vaunt my little grey cells!”\\n\\n“that’s a good job at any rate,” i said grumpily. “but what is this\\nall about?”\\n\\nas usual, when following out his own ideas, poirot paid absolutely\\nno attention to me.\\n\\n“the tradesmen’s books—i have left them entirely out of account!\\nyes, but where? where? never mind, i cannot be mistaken. we must\\nreturn at once.”\\n\\neasier said than done. we managed to get a slow train to exeter,\\nand there poirot hired a car. we arrived back at crabtree manor in\\nthe small hours of the morning. i pass over the bewilderment of\\nthe bakers when we had at last aroused them. paying no attention\\nto anybody, poirot strode at once to the study.\\n\\n“i have been, not a triple imbecile, but thirty-six times one, my\\nfriend,” he deigned to remark. “now, behold!”\\n\\ngoing straight to the desk, he drew out the key, and detached the\\nenvelope from it. i stared at him stupidly. how could he possibly\\nhope to find a big will-form in that tiny envelope? with great care\\nhe cut open the envelope, laying it out flat. then he lighted the\\nfire and held the plain inside surface of the envelope to the\\nflame. in a few minutes faint characters began to appear.\\n\\n“look, _mon ami_!” cried poirot in triumph.\\n\\ni looked. there were just a few lines of faint writing stating\\nbriefly that he left everything to his niece, violet marsh. it was\\ndated march 25, 12.30 p.m., and witnessed by albert pike,\\nconfectioner, and jessie pike, married woman.\\n\\n“but is it legal?” i gasped.\\n\\n“as far as i know, there is no law against writing your will in a\\nblend of disappearing and sympathetic ink. the intention of the\\ntestator is clear, and the beneficiary is his only living relation.\\nbut the cleverness of him! he foresaw every step that a searcher\\nwould take—that i, miserable imbecile, took. he gets two will-forms,\\nmakes the servants sign twice, then sallies out with his will\\nwritten on the inside of a dirty envelope and a fountain-pen\\ncontaining his little ink mixture. on some excuse he gets the\\nconfectioner and his wife to sign their names under his own\\nsignature, then he ties it to the key of his desk and chuckles to\\nhimself. if his niece sees through his little ruse, she will have\\njustified her choice of life and elaborate education, and be\\nthoroughly welcome to his money.”\\n\\n“she didn’t see through it, did she?” i said slowly. “it seems\\nrather unfair. the old man really won.”\\n\\n“but no, hastings. it is _your_ wits that go astray. miss marsh\\nproved the astuteness of her wits and the value of the higher\\neducation for women by at once putting the matter in _my_ hands.\\nalways employ the expert. she has amply proved her right to the\\nmoney.”\\n\\ni wonder—i very much wonder—what old andrew marsh would have\\nthought!\\n\\n\\n  the end\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nend of the project gutenberg ebook of poirot investigates, by agatha

ejaculated suddenly beneath my breath what is mon ami asked poirot placidly from the depths of his comfortable chair deduce poirot from the following facts here is a young lady richly dressedfashionable hat magnificent furs she is coming along slowly looking up at the houses as she goes unknown to her she is being shadowed by three men and a middleaged woman they have just been joined by an errand boy who points after the girl gesticulating as he does so what drama is this being played is the girl a crook and are the shadowers detectives preparing to arrest her or are they the scoundrels and are they plotting to attack an innocent victim what does the great detective say the great detective mon ami chooses as ever the simplest course he rises to see for himself and my friend joined me at the window in a minute he gave vent to an amused chuckle as usual your facts are tinged with your incurable romanticism that is miss mary marvell the film star she is being followed by a bevy of admirers who have recognized her and en passant my dear hastings she is quite aware of the fact i laughed so all is explained but you get no marks for that poirot it was a mere matter of recognition en vrit and how many times have you seen mary marvell on the screen mon cher i thought about a dozen times perhaps and ionce yet i recognize her and you do not she looks so different i replied rather feebly ah sacr cried poirot is it that you expect her to promenade herself in the streets of london in a cowboy hat or with bare feet and a bunch of curls as an irish colleen always with you it is the nonessentials remember the case of the dancer valerie saintclair i shrugged my shoulders slightly annoyed but console yourself mon ami said poirot calming down all cannot be as hercule poirot i know it well you really have the best opinion of yourself of anyone i ever knew i cried divided between amusement and annoyance what will you when one is unique one knows it and others share that opinioneven if i mistake not miss mary marvell what without doubt she is coming here how do you make that out very simply this street it is not aristocratic mon ami in it there is no fashionable doctor no fashionable dentiststill less is there a fashionable milliner but there is a fashionable detective oui my friend it is truei am become the mode the dernier cri one says to another comment you have lost your gold pencilcase you must go to the little belgian he is too marvellous every one goes courez and they arrive in flocks mon ami with problems of the most foolish a bell rang below what did i tell you that is miss marvell as usual poirot was right after a short interval the american film star was ushered in and we rose to our feet mary marvell was undoubtedly one of the most popular actresses on the screen she had only lately arrived in england in company with her husband gregory b rolf also a film actor their marriage had taken place about a year ago in the states and this was their first visit to england they had been given a great reception every one was prepared to go mad over mary marvell her wonderful clothes her furs her jewels above all one jewel the great diamond which had been nicknamed to match its owner the western star much true and untrue had been written about this famous stone which was reported to be insured for the enormous sum of fifty thousand pounds all these details passed rapidly through my mind as i joined with poirot in greeting our fair client miss marvell was small and slender very fair and girlishlooking with the wide innocent blue eyes of a child poirot drew forward a chair for her and she commenced talking at once you will probably think me very foolish monsieur poirot but lord cronshaw was telling me last night how wonderfully you cleared up the mystery of his nephews death and i felt that i just must have your advice i dare say its only a silly hoaxgregory says sobut its just worrying me to death she paused for breath poirot beamed encouragement proceed madame you comprehend i am still in the dark its these letters miss marvell unclasped her handbag and drew out three envelopes which she handed to poirot the latter scrutinized them closely cheap paperthe name and address carefully printed let us see the inside he drew out the enclosure i had joined him and was leaning over his shoulder the writing consisted of a single sentence carefully printed like the envelope it ran as follows the great diamond which is the left eye of the god must return whence it came the second letter was couched in precisely the same terms but the third was more explicit you have been warned you have not obeyed now the diamond will be taken from you at the full of the moon the two diamonds which are the left and right eye of the god shall return so it is written the first letter i treated as a joke explained miss marvell when i got the second i began to wonder the third one came yesterday and it seemed to me that after all the matter might be more serious than i had imagined i see they did not come by post these letters no they were left by handby a chinaman that is what frightens me why because it was from a chink in san francisco that gregory bought the stone three years ago i see madame that you believe the diamond referred to to be the western star finished miss marvell thats so at the time gregory remembers that there was some story attached to the stone but the chink wasnt handing out any information gregory says he seemed just scared to death and in a mortal hurry to get rid of the thing he only asked about a tenth of its value it was gregs wedding present to me poirot nodded thoughtfully the story seems of an almost unbelievable romanticism and yetwho knows i pray of you hastings hand me my little almanac i complied voyons said poirot turning the leaves when is the date of the full moon ah friday next that is in three days time eh bien madame you seek my advicei give it to you this belle histoire may be a hoaxbut it may not therefore i counsel you to place the diamond in my keeping until after friday next then we can take what steps we please a slight cloud passed over the actresss face and she replied constrainedly im afraid thats impossible you have it with youhein poirot was watching her narrowly the girl hesitated a moment then slipped her hand into the bosom of her gown drawing out a long thin chain she leaned forward unclosing her hand in the palm a stone of white fire exquisitely set in platinum lay and winked at us solemnly poirot drew in his breath with a long hiss patant he murmured you permit madame he took the jewel in his own hand and scrutinized it keenly then restored it to her with a little bow a magnificent stonewithout a flaw ah cent tonnerres and you carry it about with you comme a no no im very careful really monsieur poirot as a rule its locked up in my jewelcase and left in the hotel safe deposit were staying at the magnificent you know i just brought it along today for you to see and you will leave it with me nestce pas you will be advised by papa poirot well you see its this way monsieur poirot on friday were going down to yardly chase to spend a few days with lord and lady yardly her words awoke a vague echo of remembrance in my mind some gossipwhat was it now a few years ago lord and lady yardly had paid a visit to the states rumour had it that his lordship had rather gone the pace out there with the assistance of some lady friendsbut surely there was something more some gossip which coupled lady yardlys name with that of a movie star in californiawhy it came to me in a flashof course it was none other than gregory b rolf ill let you into a little secret monsieur poirot miss marvell was continuing weve got a deal on with lord yardly theres some chance of our arranging to film a play down there in his ancestral pile at yardly chase i cried interested why its one of the show places of england miss marvell nodded i guess its the real old feudal stuff all right but he wants a pretty stiff price and of course i dont know yet whether the deal will go through but greg and i always like to combine business with pleasure buti demand pardon if i am dense madamesurely it is possible to visit yardly chase without taking the diamond with you a shrewd hard look came into miss marvells eyes which belied their childlike appearance she looked suddenly a good deal older i want to wear it down there surely i said suddenly there are some very famous jewels in the yardly collection a large diamond amongst them thats so said miss marvell briefly i heard poirot murmur beneath his breath ah cest comme a then he said aloud with his usual uncanny luck in hitting the bullseye he dignifies it by the name of psychology then you are without doubt already acquainted with lady yardly or perhaps your husband is gregory knew her when she was out west three years ago said miss marvell she hesitated a moment and then added abruptly do either of you ever see society gossip we both pleaded guilty rather shamefacedly i ask because in this weeks number there is an article on famous jewels and its really very curious she broke off i rose went to the table at the other side of the room and returned with the paper in question in my hand she took it from me found the article and began to read aloud    amongst other famous stones may be included the star of the east a diamond in the possession of the yardly family an ancestor of the present lord yardly brought it back with him from china and a romantic story is said to attach to it according to this the stone was once the right eye of a temple god another diamond exactly similar in form and size formed the left eye and the story goes that this jewel too would in course of time be stolen one eye shall go west the other east till they shall meet once more then in triumph shall they return to the god it is a curious coincidence that there is at the present time a stone corresponding closely in description with this one and known as the star of the west or the western star it is the property of the celebrated film actress miss mary marvell a comparison of the two stones would be interesting she stopped patant murmured poirot without doubt a romance of the first water he turned to mary marvell and you are not afraid madame you have no superstitious terrors you do not fear to introduce these two siamese twins to each other lest a chinaman should appear and hey presto whisk them both back to china his tone was mocking but i fancied that an undercurrent of seriousness lay beneath it i dont believe that lady yardlys diamond is anything like as good a stone as mine said miss marvell anyway im going to see what more poirot would have said i do not know for at that moment the door flew open and a splendidlooking man strode into the room from his crisply curling black head to the tips of his patentleather boots he was a hero fit for romance i said id call round for you mary said gregory rolf and here i am well what does monsieur poirot say to our little problem just one big hoax same as i do poirot smiled up at the big actor they made a ridiculous contrast hoax or no hoax mr rolf he said dryly i have advised madame your wife not to take the jewel with her to yardly chase on friday im with you there sir ive already said so to mary but there shes a woman through and through and i guess she cant bear to think of another woman outshining her in the jewel line what nonsense gregory said mary marvell sharply but she flushed angrily poirot shrugged his shoulders madame i have advised i can do no more cest fini he bowed them both to the door ah la la he observed returning histoire de femmes the good husband he hit the nail on the headtout de mme he was not tactful assuredly not i imparted to him my vague remembrances and he nodded vigorously so i thought all the same there is something curious underneath all this with your permission mon ami i will take the air await my return i beg of you i shall not be long i was half asleep in my chair when the landlady tapped on the door and put her head in its another lady to see mr poirot sir ive told her he was out but she says as how shell wait seeing as shes come up from the country oh show her in here mrs murchison perhaps i can do something for her in another moment the lady had been ushered in my heart gave a leap as i recognized her lady yardlys portrait had figured too often in the society papers to allow her to remain unknown do sit down lady yardly i said drawing forward a chair my friend poirot is out but i know for a fact that hell be back very shortly she thanked me and sat down a very different type this from miss mary marvell tall dark with flashing eyes and a pale proud faceyet something wistful in the curves of the mouth i felt a desire to rise to the occasion why not in poirots presence i have frequently felt a difficultyi do not appear at my best and yet there is no doubt that i too possess the deductive sense in a marked degree i leant forward on a sudden impulse lady yardly i said i know why you have come here you have received blackmailing letters about the diamond there was no doubt as to my bolt having shot home she stared at me openmouthed all colour banished from her cheeks you know she gasped how i smiled by a perfectly logical process if miss marvell has had warning letters miss marvell she has been here she has just left as i was saying if she as the holder of one of the twin diamonds has received a mysterious series of warnings you as the holder of the other stone must necessarily have done the same you see how simple it is i am right then you have received these strange communications also for a moment she hesitated as though in doubt whether to trust me or not then she bowed her head in assent with a little smile that is so she acknowledged were yours too left by handby a chinaman no they came by post but tell me has miss marvell undergone the same experience then i recounted to her the events of the morning she listened attentively it all fits in my letters are the duplicates of hers it is true that they came by post but there is a curious perfume impregnating themsomething in the nature of jossstickthat at once suggested the east to me what does it all mean i shook my head that is what we must find out you have the letters with you we might learn something from the postmarks unfortunately i destroyed them you understand at the time i regarded it as some foolish joke can it be true that some chinese gang are really trying to recover the diamonds it seems too incredible we went over the facts again and again but could get no further towards the elucidation of the mystery at last lady yardly rose i really dont think i need wait for monsieur poirot you can tell him all this cant you thank you so much mr she hesitated her hand outstretched captain hastings of course how stupid of me youre a friend of the cavendishes arent you it was mary cavendish who sent me to monsieur poirot when my friend returned i enjoyed telling him the tale of what had occurred during his absence he crossquestioned me rather sharply over the details of our conversation and i could read between the lines that he was not best pleased to have been absent i also fancied that the dear old fellow was just the least inclined to be jealous it had become rather a pose with him to consistently belittle my abilities and i think he was chagrined at finding no loophole for criticism i was secretly rather pleased with myself though i tried to conceal the fact for fear of irritating him in spite of his idiosyncrasies i was deeply attached to my quaint little friend bien he said at length with a curious look on his face the plot develops pass me i pray you that peerage on the top shelf there he turned the leaves ah here we are yardly    th viscount served south african war    tout a na pas dimportance    mar  hon maude stopperton fourth daughter of rd baron cotteril    um um um    has iss two daughters born      clubs    residences    voil that does not tell us much but tomorrow morning we see this milord what yes i telegraphed to him i thought you had washed your hands of the case i am not acting for miss marvell since she refuses to be guided by my advice what i do now is for my own satisfactionthe satisfaction of hercule poirot decidedly i must have a finger in this pie and you calmly wire lord yardly to dash up to town just to suit your convenience he wont be pleased au contraire if i preserve for him his family diamond he ought to be very grateful then you really think there is a chance of it being stolen i asked eagerly almost a certainty replied poirot placidly everything points that way but how poirot stopped my eager questions with an airy gesture of the hand not now i pray you let us not confuse the mind and observe that peeragehow you have replaced him see you not that the tallest books go in the top shelf the next tallest in the row beneath and so on thus we have order method which as i have often told you hastings exactly i said hastily and put the offending volume in its proper place                      lord yardly turned out to be a cheery loudvoiced sportsman with a rather red face but with a goodhumoured bonhomie about him that was distinctly attractive and made up for any lack of mentality extraordinary business this monsieur poirot cant make head or tail of it seems my wifes been getting odd kind of letters and that this miss marvells had em too what does it all mean poirot handed him the copy of society gossip first milord i would ask you if these facts are substantially correct the peer took it his face darkened with anger as he read damned nonsense he spluttered theres never been any romantic story attaching to the diamond it came from india originally i believe i never heard of all this chinese god stuff still the stone is known as the star of the east well what if it is he demanded wrathfully poirot smiled a little but made no direct reply what i would ask you to do milord is to place yourself in my hands if you do so unreservedly i have great hopes of averting the catastrophe then you think theres actually something in these wildcat tales will you do as i ask you of course i will but bien then permit that i ask you a few questions this affair of yardly chase is it as you say all fixed up between you and mr rolf oh he told you about it did he no theres nothing settled he hesitated the brickred colour of his face deepening might as well get the thing straight ive made rather an ass of myself in many ways monsieur poirotand im head over ears in debtbut i want to pull up im fond of the kids and i want to straighten things up and be able to live on at the old place gregory rolf is offering me big moneyenough to set me on my feet again i dont want to do iti hate the thought of all that crowd playacting round the chasebut i may have to unless he broke off poirot eyed him keenly you have then another string to your bow permit that i make a guess it is to sell the star of the east lord yardly nodded thats it its been in the family for some generations but its not entailed still its not the easiest thing in the world to find a purchaser hoffberg the hatton garden man is on the lookout for a likely customer but hell have to find one soon or its a washout one more question permettezlady yardly which plan does she approve oh shes bitterly opposed to my selling the jewel you know what women are shes all for this film stunt i comprehend said poirot he remained a moment or so in thought then rose briskly to his feet you return to yardly chase at once bien say no word to anyoneto anyone mindbut expect us there this evening we will arrive shortly after five all right but i dont see a na pas dimportance said poirot kindly you will that i preserve for you your diamond nestce pas yes but then do as i say a sadly bewildered nobleman left the room                      it was halfpast five when we arrived at yardly chase and followed the dignified butler to the old panelled hall with its fire of blazing logs a pretty picture met our eyes lady yardly and her two children the mothers proud dark head bent down over the two fair ones lord yardly stood near smiling down on them monsieur poirot and captain hastings announced the butler lady yardly looked up with a start her husband came forward uncertainly his eyes seeking instruction from poirot the little man was equal to the occasion all my excuses it is that i investigate still this affair of miss marvells she comes to you on friday does she not i make a little tour first to make sure that all is secure also i wanted to ask of lady yardly if she recollected at all the postmarks on the letters she received lady yardly shook her head regretfully im afraid i dont it is stupid of me but you see i never dreamt of taking them seriously youll stay the night said lord yardly oh milord i fear to incommode you we have left our bags at the inn thats all right lord yardly had his cue well send down for them no nono trouble i assure you poirot permitted himself to be persuaded and sitting down by lady yardly began to make friends with the children in a short time they were all romping together and had dragged me into the game vous tes bonne mre said poirot with a gallant little bow as the children were removed reluctantly by a stern nurse lady yardly smoothed her ruffled hair i adore them she said with a little catch in her voice and they youwith reason poirot bowed again a dressinggong sounded and we rose to go up to our rooms at that moment the butler entered with a telegram on a salver which he handed to lord yardly the latter tore it open with a brief word of apology as he read it he stiffened visibly with an ejaculation he handed it to his wife then he glanced at my friend just a minute monsieur poirot i feel you ought to know about this its from hoffberg he thinks hes found a customer for the diamondan american sailing for the states tomorrow theyre sending down a chap tonight to vet the stone by jove though if this goes through words failed him lady yardly had turned away she still held the telegram in her hand i wish you wouldnt sell it george she said in a low voice its been in the family so long she waited as though for a reply but when none came her face hardened she shrugged her shoulders i must go and dress i suppose i had better display the goods she turned to poirot with a slight grimace its one of the most hideous necklaces that was ever designed george has always promised to have the stones reset for me but its never been done she left the room half an hour later we three were assembled in the great drawingroom awaiting the lady it was already a few minutes past the dinner hour suddenly there was a low rustle and lady yardly appeared framed in the doorway a radiant figure in a long white shimmering dress round the column of her neck was a rivulet of fire she stood there with one hand just touching the necklace behold the sacrifice she said gaily her illhumour seemed to have vanished wait while i turn the big light on and you shall feast your eyes on the ugliest necklace in england the switches were just outside the door as she stretched out her hand to them the incredible thing happened suddenly without any warning every light was extinguished the door banged and from the other side of it came a longdrawn piercing womans scream my god cried lord yardly that was maudes voice what has happened we rushed blindly for the door cannoning into each other in the darkness it was some minutes before we could find it what a sight met our eyes lady yardly lay senseless on the marble floor a crimson mark on her white throat where the necklace had been wrenched from her neck as we bent over her uncertain for the moment whether she were dead or alive her eyelids opened the chinaman she whispered painfully the chinamanthe side door lord yardly sprang up with an oath i accompanied him my heart beating wildly the chinaman again the side door in question was a small one in the angle of the wall not more than a dozen yards from the scene of the tragedy as we reached it i gave a cry there just short of the threshold lay the glittering necklace evidently dropped by the thief in the panic of his flight i swooped joyously down on it then i uttered another cry which lord yardly echoed for in the middle of the necklace was a great gap the star of the east was missing that settles it i breathed these were no ordinary thieves this one stone was all they wanted but how did the fellow get in through this door but its always locked i shook my head its not locked now see i pulled it open as i spoke as i did so something fluttered to the ground i picked it up it was a piece of silk and the embroidery was unmistakable it had been torn from a chinamans robe in his haste it caught in the door i explained come hurry he cannot have gone far as yet but in vain we hunted and searched in the pitch darkness of the night the thief had found it easy to make his getaway we returned reluctantly and lord yardly sent off one of the footmen posthaste to fetch the police lady yardly aptly ministered to by poirot who is as good as a woman in these matters was sufficiently recovered to be able to tell her story i was just going to turn on the other light she said when a man sprang on me from behind he tore my necklace from my neck with such force that i fell headlong to the floor as i fell i saw him disappearing through the side door then i realized by the pigtail and the embroidered robe that he was a chinaman she stopped with a shudder the butler reappeared he spoke in a low voice to lord yardly a gentleman from mr hoffbergs mlord he says you expect him good heavens cried the distracted nobleman i must see him i suppose no not here mullings in the library i drew poirot aside look here my dear fellow hadnt we better get back to london you think so hastings why welli coughed delicatelythings havent gone very well have they i mean you tell lord yardly to place himself in your hands and all will be welland then the diamond vanishes from under your very nose true said poirot rather crestfallen it was not one of my most striking triumphs this way of describing events almost caused me to smile but i stuck to my guns so havingpardon the expressionrather made a mess of things dont you think it would be more graceful to leave immediately and the dinner the without doubt excellent dinner that the chef of lord yardly has prepared oh whats dinner i said impatiently poirot held up his hands in horror mon dieu it is that in this country you treat the affairs gastronomic with a criminal indifference theres another reason why we should get back to london as soon as possible i continued what is that my friend the other diamond i said lowering my voice miss marvells eh bien what of it dont you see his unusual obtuseness annoyed me what had happened to his usually keen wits theyve got one now theyll go for the other tiens cried poirot stepping back a pace and regarding me with admiration but your brain marches to a marvel my friend figure to yourself that for the moment i had not thought of that but there is plenty of time the full of the moon it is not until friday i shook my head dubiously the full of the moon theory left me entirely cold i had my way with poirot however and we departed immediately leaving behind us a note of explanation and apology for lord yardly my idea was to go at once to the magnificent and relate to miss marvell what had occurred but poirot vetoed the plan and insisted that the morning would be time enough i gave in rather grudgingly in the morning poirot seemed strangely disinclined to stir out i began to suspect that having made a mistake to start with he was singularly loath to proceed with the case in answer to my persuasions he pointed out with admirable common sense that as the details of the affair at yardly chase were already in the morning papers the rolfs would know quite as much as we could tell them i gave way unwillingly events proved my forebodings to be justified about two oclock the telephone rang poirot answered it he listened for some moments then with a brief bien jy serai he rang off and turned to me what do you think mon ami he looked half ashamed half excited the diamond of miss marvell it has been stolen what i cried springing up and what about the full of the moon now poirot hung his head when did this happen this morning i understand i shook my head sadly if only you had listened to me you see i was right it appears so mon ami said poirot cautiously appearances are deceptive they say but it certainly appears so as we hurried in a taxi to the magnificent i puzzled out the true inwardness of the scheme that full of the moon idea was clever the whole point of it was to get us to concentrate on the friday and so be off our guard beforehand it is a pity you did not realize that ma foi said poirot airily his nonchalance quite restored after its brief eclipse one cannot think of everything i felt sorry for him he did so hate failure of any kind cheer up i said consolingly better luck next time at the magnificent we were ushered at once into the managers office gregory rolf was there with two men from scotland yard a palefaced clerk sat opposite them rolf nodded to us as we entered were getting to the bottom of it he said but its almost unbelievable how the guy had the nerve i cant think a very few minutes sufficed to give us the facts mr rolf had gone out of the hotel at  at  a gentleman so like him in appearance as to pass muster entered the hotel and demanded the jewelcase from the safe deposit he duly signed the receipt remarking carelessly as he did so looks a bit different from my ordinary one but i hurt my hand getting out of the taxi the clerk merely smiled and remarked that he saw very little difference rolf laughed and said well dont run me in as a crook this time anyway ive been getting threatening letters from a chinaman and the worst of it is i look rather like a chink myselfits something about the eyes i looked at him said the clerk who was telling us this and i saw at once what he meant the eyes slanted up at the corners like an orientals id never noticed it before darn it all man roared gregory rolf leaning forward do you notice it now the man looked up at him and started no sir he said i cant say i do and indeed there was nothing even remotely oriental about the frank brown eyes that looked into ours the scotland yard man grunted bold customer thought the eyes might be noticed and took the bull by the horns to disarm suspicion he must have watched you out of the hotel sir and nipped in as soon as you were well away what about the jewelcase i asked it was found in a corridor of the hotel only one thing had been takenthe western star we stared at each otherthe whole thing was so bizarre so unreal poirot hopped briskly to his feet i have not been of much use i fear he said regretfully is it permitted to see madame i guess shes prostrated with the shock explained rolf then perhaps i might have a few words alone with you monsieur certainly in about five minutes poirot reappeared now my friend he said gaily to a post office i have to send a telegram who to lord yardly he discounted further inquiries by slipping his arm through mine come come mon ami i know all that you feel about this miserable business i have not distinguished myself you in my place might have distinguished yourself bien all is admitted let us forget it and have lunch it was about four oclock when we entered poirots rooms a figure rose from a chair by the window it was lord yardly he looked haggard and distraught i got your wire and came up at once look here ive been round to hoffberg and they know nothing about that man of theirs last night or the wire either do you think that poirot held up his hand my excuses i sent that wire and hired the gentleman in question youbut why what the nobleman spluttered impotently my little idea was to bring things to a head explained poirot placidly bring things to a head oh my god cried lord yardly and the ruse succeeded said poirot cheerfully therefore milord i have much pleasure in returning youthis with a dramatic gesture he produced a glittering object it was a great diamond the star of the east gasped lord yardly but i dont understand no said poirot it makes no matter believe me it was necessary for the diamond to be stolen i promised you that it should be preserved to you and i have kept my word you must permit me to keep my little secret convey i beg of you the assurances of my deepest respect to lady yardly and tell her how pleased i am to be able to restore her jewel to her what beau temps is it not good day milord and smiling and talking the amazing little man conducted the bewildered nobleman to the door he returned gently rubbing his hands poirot i said am i quite demented no mon ami but you are as always in a mental fog how did you get the diamond from mr rolf rolf mais oui the warning letters the chinaman the article in society gossip all sprang from the ingenious brain of mr rolf the two diamonds supposed to be so miraculously alikebah they did not exist there was only one diamond my friend originally in the yardly collection for three years it has been in the possession of mr rolf he stole it this morning with the assistance of a touch of grease paint at the corner of each eye ah i must see him on the film he is indeed an artist celuil but why should he steal his own diamond i asked puzzled for many reasons to begin with lady yardly was getting restive lady yardly you comprehend she was left much alone in california her husband was amusing himself elsewhere mr rolf was handsome he had an air about him of romance but au fond he is very businesslike ce monsieur he made love to lady yardly and then he blackmailed her i taxed the lady with the truth the other night and she admitted it she swore that she had only been indiscreet and i believe her but undoubtedly rolf had letters of hers that could be twisted to bear a different interpretation terrified by the threat of a divorce and the prospect of being separated from her children she agreed to all he wished she had no money of her own and she was forced to permit him to substitute a paste replica for the real stone the coincidence of the date of the appearance of the western star struck me at once all goes well lord yardly prepares to range himselfto settle down and then comes the menace of the possible sale of the diamond the substitution will be discovered without doubt she writes off frantically to gregory rolf who has just arrived in england he soothes her by promising to arrange alland prepares for a double robbery in this way he will quiet the lady who might conceivably tell all to her husband an affair which would not suit our blackmailer at all he will have  insurance money aha you had forgotten that and he will still have the diamond at this point i put my finger in the pie the arrival of a diamond expert is announced lady yardly as i felt sure she would immediately arranges a robberyand does it very well too but hercule poirot he sees nothing but facts what happens in actuality the lady switches off the light bangs the door throws the necklace down the passage and screams she has already wrenched out the diamond with pliers upstairs but we saw the necklace round her neck i objected i demand pardon my friend her hand concealed the part of it where the gap would have shown to place a piece of silk in the door beforehand is childs play of course as soon as rolf read of the robbery he arranged his own little comedy and very well he played it what did you say to him i asked with lively curiosity i said to him that lady yardly had told her husband all that i was empowered to recover the jewel and that if it were not immediately handed over proceedings would be taken also a few more little lies which occurred to me he was as wax in my hands i pondered the matter it seems a little unfair on mary marvell she has lost her diamond through no fault of her own bah said poirot brutally she has a magnificent advertisement that is all she cares for that one now the other she is different bonne mre trs femme yes i said doubtfully hardly sharing poirots views on femininity i suppose it was rolf who sent her the duplicate letters pas du tout said poirot briskly she came by the advice of mary cavendish to seek my aid in her dilemma then she heard that mary marvell whom she knew to be her enemy had been here and she changed her mind jumping at a pretext that you my friend offered her a very few questions sufficed to show me that you told her of the letters not she you she jumped at the chance your words offered i dont believe it i cried stung si si mon ami it is a pity that you study not the psychology she told you that the letters were destroyed oh la la never does a woman destroy a letter if she can avoid it not even if it would be more prudent to do so its all very well i said my anger rising but youve made a perfect fool of me from beginning to end no its all very well to try and explain it away afterwards there really is a limit but you were so enjoying yourself my friend i had not the heart to shatter your illusions its no good youve gone a bit too far this time mon dieu but how you enrage yourself for nothing mon ami im fed up i went out banging the door poirot had made an absolute laughingstock of me i decided that he needed a sharp lesson i would let some time elapse before i forgave him he had encouraged me to make a perfect fool of myself   ii   the tragedy at marsdon manor i had been called away from town for a few days and on my return found poirot in the act of strapping up his small valise a la bonne heure hastings i feared you would not have returned in time to accompany me you are called away on a case then yes though i am bound to admit that on the face of it the affair does not seem promising the northern union insurance company have asked me to investigate the death of a mr maltravers who a few weeks ago insured his life with them for the large sum of fifty thousand pounds yes i said much interested there was of course the usual suicide clause in the policy in the event of his committing suicide within a year the premiums would be forfeited mr maltravers was duly examined by the companys own doctor and although he was a man slightly past the prime of life was passed as being in quite sound health however on wednesday lastthe day before yesterdaythe body of mr maltravers was found in the grounds of his house in essex marsdon manor and the cause of his death is described as some kind of internal hmorrhage that in itself would be nothing remarkable but sinister rumours as to mr maltravers financial position have been in the air of late and the northern union have ascertained beyond any possible doubt that the deceased gentleman stood upon the verge of bankruptcy now that alters matters considerably maltravers had a beautiful young wife and it is suggested that he got together all the ready money he could for the purpose of paying the premiums on a life insurance for his wifes benefit and then committed suicide such a thing is not uncommon in any case my friend alfred wright who is a director of the northern union has asked me to investigate the facts of the case but as i told him i am not very hopeful of success if the cause of the death had been heart failure i should have been more sanguine heart failure may always be translated as the inability of the local gp to discover what his patient really did die of but a hmorrhage seems fairly definite still we can but make some necessary inquiries five minutes to pack your bag hastings and we will take a taxi to liverpool street about an hour later we alighted from a great eastern train at the little station of marsdon leigh inquiries at the station yielded the information that marsdon manor was about a mile distant poirot decided to walk and we betook ourselves along the main street what is our plan of campaign i asked first i will call upon the doctor i have ascertained that there is only one doctor in marsdon leigh dr ralph bernard ah here we are at his house the house in question was a kind of superior cottage standing back a little from the road a brass plate on the gate bore the doctors name we passed up the path and rang the bell we proved to be fortunate in our call it was the doctors consulting hour and for the moment there were no patients waiting for him dr bernard was an elderly man highshouldered and stooping with a pleasant vagueness of manner poirot introduced himself and explained the purpose of our visit adding that insurance companies were bound to investigate fully in a case of this kind of course of course said dr bernard vaguely i suppose as he was such a rich man his life was insured for a big sum you consider him a rich man doctor the doctor looked rather surprised was he not he kept two cars you know and marsdon manor is a pretty big place to keep up although i believe he bought it very cheap i understand that he had had considerable losses of late said poirot watching the doctor narrowly the latter however merely shook his head sadly is that so indeed it is fortunate for his wife then that there is this life insurance a very beautiful and charming young creature but terribly unstrung by this sad catastrophe a mass of nerves poor thing i have tried to spare her all i can but of course the shock was bound to be considerable you had been attending mr maltravers recently my dear sir i never attended him what i understand mr maltravers was a christian scientistor something of that kind but you examined the body certainly i was fetched by one of the undergardeners and the cause of death was clear absolutely there was blood on the lips but most of the bleeding must have been internal was he still lying where he had been found yes the body had not been touched he was lying at the edge of a small plantation he had evidently been out shooting rooks a small rook rifle lay beside him the hmorrhage must have occurred quite suddenly gastric ulcer without a doubt no question of his having been shot eh my dear sir i demand pardon said poirot humbly but if my memory is not at fault in the case of a recent murder the doctor first gave a verdict of heart failurealtering it when the local constable pointed out that there was a bullet wound through the head you will not find any bullet wounds on the body of mr maltravers said dr bernard dryly now gentlemen if there is nothing further we took the hint good morning and many thanks to you doctor for so kindly answering our questions by the way you saw no need for an autopsy certainly not the doctor became quite apoplectic the cause of death was clear and in my profession we see no need to distress unduly the relatives of a dead patient and turning the doctor slammed the door sharply in our faces and what do you think of dr bernard hastings inquired poirot as we proceeded on our way to the manor rather an old ass exactly your judgments of character are always profound my friend i glanced at him uneasily but he seemed perfectly serious a twinkle however came into his eye and he added slyly that is to say when there is no question of a beautiful woman i looked at him coldly on our arrival at the manorhouse the door was opened to us by a middleaged parlourmaid poirot handed her his card and a letter from the insurance company for mrs maltravers she showed us into a small morningroom and retired to tell her mistress about ten minutes elapsed and then the door opened and a slender figure in widows weeds stood upon the threshold monsieur poirot she faltered madame poirot sprang gallantly to his feet and hastened towards her i cannot tell you how i regret to derange you in this way but what will you les affairesthey know no mercy mrs maltravers permitted him to lead her to a chair her eyes were red with weeping but the temporary disfigurement could not conceal her extraordinary beauty she was about twentyseven or eight and very fair with large blue eyes and a pretty pouting mouth it is something about my husbands insurance is it but must i be bothered nowso soon courage my dear madame courage you see your late husband insured his life for rather a large sum and in such a case the company always has to satisfy itself as to a few details they have empowered me to act for them you can rest assured that i will do all in my power to render the matter not too unpleasant for you will you recount to me briefly the sad events of wednesday i was changing for tea when my maid came upone of the gardeners had just run to the house he had found her voice trailed away poirot pressed her hand sympathetically i comprehend enough you had seen your husband earlier in the afternoon not since lunch i had walked down to the village for some stamps and i believe he was out pottering round the grounds shooting rooks eh yes he usually took his little rook rifle with him and i heard one or two shots in the distance where is this little rook rifle now in the hall i think she led the way out of the room and found and handed the little weapon to poirot who examined it cursorily two shots fired i see he observed as he handed it back and now madame if i might see he paused delicately the servant shall take you she murmured averting her head the parlourmaid summoned led poirot upstairs i remained with the lovely and unfortunate woman it was hard to know whether to speak or remain silent i essayed one or two general reflections to which she responded absently and in a very few minutes poirot rejoined us i thank you for all your courtesy madame i do not think you need be troubled any further with this matter by the way do you know anything of your husbands financial position she shook her head nothing whatever i am very stupid over business things i see then you can give us no clue as to why he suddenly decided to insure his life he had not done so previously i understand well we had only been married a little over a year but as to why he insured his life it was because he had absolutely made up his mind that he would not live long he had a strong premonition of his own death i gather that he had had one hmorrhage already and that he knew that another one would prove fatal i tried to dispel these gloomy fears of his but without avail alas he was only too right tears in her eyes she bade us a dignified farewell poirot made a characteristic gesture as we walked down the drive together eh bien that is that back to london my friend there appears to be no mouse in this mousehole and yet yet what a slight discrepancy that is all you noticed it you did not still life is full of discrepancies and assuredly the man cannot have taken his own lifethere is no poison that would fill his mouth with blood no no i must resign myself to the fact that all here is clear and aboveboardbut who is this a tall young man was striding up the drive towards us he passed us without making any sign but i noted that he was not illlooking with a lean deeply bronzed face that spoke of life in a tropic clime a gardener who was sweeping up leaves had paused for a minute in his task and poirot ran quickly up to him tell me i pray you who is that gentleman do you know him i dont remember his name sir though i did hear it he was staying down here last week for a night tuesday it was quick mon ami let us follow him we hastened up the drive after the retreating figure a glimpse of a blackrobed figure on the terrace at the side of the house and our quarry swerved and we after him so that we were witnesses of the meeting mrs maltravers almost staggered where she stood and her face blanched noticeably you she gasped i thought you were on the seaon your way to east africa i got some news from my lawyers that detained me explained the young man my old uncle in scotland died unexpectedly and left me some money under the circumstances i thought it better to cancel my passage then i saw this bad news in the paper and i came down to see if there was anything i could do youll want some one to look after things for you a bit perhaps at that moment they became aware of our presence poirot stepped forward and with many apologies explained that he had left his stick in the hall rather reluctantly it seemed to me mrs maltravers made the necessary introduction monsieur poirot captain black a few minutes chat ensued in the course of which poirot elicited the fact that captain black was putting up at the anchor inn the missing stick not having been discovered which was not surprising poirot uttered more apologies and we withdrew we returned to the village at a great pace and poirot made a bee line for the anchor inn here we establish ourselves until our friend the captain returns he explained you notice that i emphasized the point that we were returning to london by the first train possibly you thought i meant it but noyou observed mrs maltravers face when she caught sight of this young black she was clearly taken aback and heeh bien he was very devoted did you not think so and he was here on tuesday nightthe day before mr maltravers died we must investigate the doings of captain black hastings in about half an hour we espied our quarry approaching the inn poirot went out and accosted him and presently brought him up to the room we had engaged i have been telling captain black of the mission which brings us here he explained you can understand monsieur le capitaine that i am anxious to arrive at mr maltravers state of mind immediately before his death and that at the same time i do not wish to distress mrs maltravers unduly by asking her painful questions now you were here just before the occurrence and can give us equally valuable information ill do anything i can to help you im sure replied the young soldier but im afraid i didnt notice anything out of the ordinary you see although maltravers was an old friend of my peoples i didnt know him very well myself you came downwhen tuesday afternoon i went up to town early wednesday morning as my boat sailed from tilbury about twelve oclock but some news i got made me alter my plans as i dare say you heard me explain to mrs maltravers you were returning to east africa i understand yes ive been out there ever since the wara great country exactly now what was the talk about at dinner on tuesday night oh i dont know the usual odd topics maltravers asked after my people and then we discussed the question of german reparations and then mrs maltravers asked a lot of questions about east africa and i told them one or two yarns thats about all i think thank you poirot was silent for a moment then he said gently with your permission i should like to try a little experiment you have told us all that your conscious self knows i want now to question your subconscious self psychoanalysis what said black with visible alarm oh no said poirot reassuringly you see it is like this i give you a word you answer with another and so on any word the first one you think of shall we begin all right said black slowly but he looked uneasy note down the words please hastings said poirot then he took from his pocket his big turnipfaced watch and laid it on the table beside him we will commence day there was a moments pause and then black replied night as poirot proceeded his answers came quicker name said poirot place bernard shaw tuesday dinner journey ship country uganda story lions rook rifle farm shot suicide elephant tusks money lawyers thank you captain black perhaps you could spare me a few minutes in about half an hours time certainly the young soldier looked at him curiously and wiped his brow as he got up and now hastings said poirot smiling at me as the door closed behind him you see it all do you not i dont know what you mean does that list of words tell you nothing i scrutinized it but was forced to shake my head i will assist you to begin with black answered well within the normal time limit with no pauses so we can take it that he himself has no guilty knowledge to conceal day to night and place to name are normal associations i began work with bernard which might have suggested the local doctor had he come across him at all evidently he had not after our recent conversation he gave dinner to my tuesday but journey and country were answered by ship and uganda showing clearly that it was his journey abroad that was important to him and not the one which brought him down here story recalls to him one of the lion stories he told at dinner i proceed to rook rifle and he answered with the totally unexpected word farm when i say shot he answers at once suicide the association seems clear a man he knows committed suicide with a rook rifle on a farm somewhere remember too that his mind is still on the stories he told at dinner and i think you will agree that i shall not be far from the truth if i recall captain black and ask him to repeat the particular suicide story which he told at the dinnertable on tuesday evening black was straightforward enough over the matter yes i did tell them that story now that i come to think of it chap shot himself on a farm out there did it with a rook rifle through the roof of the mouth bullet lodged in the brain doctors were no end puzzled over itthere was nothing to show except a little blood on the lips but what what has it got to do with mr maltravers you did not know i see that he was found with a rook rifle by his side you mean my story suggested to himoh but that is awful do not distress yourselfit would have been one way or another well i must get on the telephone to london poirot had a lengthy conversation over the wire and came back thoughtful he went off by himself in the afternoon and it was not till seven oclock that he announced that he could put it off no longer but must break the news to the young widow my sympathy had already gone out to her unreservedly to be left penniless and with the knowledge that her husband had killed himself to assure her future was a hard burden for any woman to bear i cherished a secret hope however that young black might prove capable of consoling her after her first grief had passed he evidently admired her enormously our interview with the lady was painful she refused vehemently to believe the facts that poirot advanced and when she was at last convinced broke down into bitter weeping an examination of the body turned our suspicions into certainty poirot was very sorry for the poor lady but after all he was employed by the insurance company and what could he do as he was preparing to leave he said gently to mrs maltravers madame you of all people should know that there are no dead what do you mean she faltered her eyes growing wide have you never taken part in any spiritualistic sances you are mediumistic you know i have been told so but you do not believe in spiritualism surely madame i have seen some strange things you know that they say in the village that this house is haunted she nodded and at that moment the parlourmaid announced that dinner was ready wont you just stay and have something to eat we accepted gratefully and i felt that our presence could not but help distract her a little from her own griefs we had just finished our soup when there was a scream outside the door and the sound of breaking crockery we jumped up the parlourmaid appeared her hand to her heart it was a manstanding in the passage poirot rushed out returning quickly there is no one there isnt there sir said the parlourmaid weakly oh it did give me a start but why she dropped her voice to a whisper i thoughti thought it was the masterit looked like im i saw mrs maltravers give a terrified start and my mind flew to the old superstition that a suicide cannot rest she thought of it too i am sure for a minute later she caught poirots arm with a scream didnt you hear that those three taps on the window thats how he always used to tap when he passed round the house the ivy i cried it was the ivy against the pane but a sort of terror was gaining on us all the parlourmaid was obviously unstrung and when the meal was over mrs maltravers besought poirot not to go at once she was clearly terrified to be left alone we sat in the little morningroom the wind was getting up and moaning round the house in an eerie fashion twice the door of the room came unlatched and the door slowly opened and each time she clung to me with a terrified gasp ah but this door it is bewitched cried poirot angrily at last he got up and shut it once more then turned the key in the lock i shall lock it so dont do that she gasped if it should come open now and even as she spoke the impossible happened the locked door slowly swung open i could not see into the passage from where i sat but she and poirot were facing it she gave one long shriek as she turned to him you saw himthere in the passage she cried he was staring down at her with a puzzled face then shook his head i saw himmy husbandyou must have seen him too madame i saw nothing you are not wellunstrung i am perfectly well ioh god suddenly without any warning the lights quivered and went out out of the darkness came three loud raps i could hear mrs maltravers moaning and theni saw the man i had seen on the bed upstairs stood there facing us gleaming with a faint ghostly light there was blood on his lips and he held his right hand out pointing suddenly a brilliant light seemed to proceed from it it passed over poirot and me and fell on mrs maltravers i saw her white terrified face and something else my god poirot i cried look at her hand her right hand its all red her own eyes fell on it and she collapsed in a heap on the floor blood she cried hysterically yes its blood i killed him i did it he was showing me and then i put my hand on the trigger and pressed save me from himsave me hes come back her voice died away in a gurgle lights said poirot briskly the lights went on as if by magic thats it he continued you heard hastings and you everett oh by the way this is mr everett rather a fine member of the theatrical profession i phoned to him this afternoon his makeup is good isnt it quite like the dead man and with a pocket torch and the necessary phosphorescence he made the proper impression i shouldnt touch her right hand if i were you hastings red paint marks so when the lights went out i clasped her hand you see by the way we mustnt miss our train inspector japp is outside the window a bad nightbut he has been able to while away the time by tapping on the window every now and then you see continued poirot as we walked briskly through the wind and rain there was a little discrepancy the doctor seemed to think the deceased was a christian scientist and who could have given him that impression but mrs maltravers but to us she represented him as being in a grave state of apprehension about his own health again why was she so taken aback by the reappearance of young black and lastly although i know that convention decrees that a woman must make a decent pretence of mourning for her husband i do not care for such heavilyrouged eyelids you did not observe them hastings no as i always tell you you see nothing well there it was there were the two possibilities did blacks story suggest an ingenious method of committing suicide to mr maltravers or did his other listener the wife see an equally ingenious method of committing murder i inclined to the latter view to shoot himself in the way indicated he would probably have had to pull the trigger with his toeor at least so i imagine now if maltravers had been found with one boot off we should almost certainly have heard of it from some one an odd detail like that would have been remembered no as i say i inclined to the view that it was a case of murder not suicide but i realized that i had not a shadow of proof in support of my theory hence the elaborate little comedy you saw played tonight even now i dont quite see all the details of the crime i said let us start from the beginning here is a shrewd and scheming woman who knowing of her husbands financial dbcle and tired of the elderly mate she has only married for his money induces him to insure his life for a large sum and then seeks for the means to accomplish her purpose an accident gives her thatthe young soldiers strange story the next afternoon when monsieur le capitaine as she thinks is on the high seas she and her husband are strolling round the grounds what a curious story that was last night she observes could a man shoot himself in such a way do show me if it is possible the poor foolhe shows her he places the end of the rifle in his mouth she stoops down and puts her finger on the trigger laughing up at him and now sir she says saucily supposing i pull the trigger and thenand then hastingsshe pulls it   iii   the adventure of the cheap flat so far in the cases which i have recorded poirots investigations have started from the central fact whether murder or robbery and have proceeded from thence by a process of logical deduction to the final triumphant unravelling in the events i am now about to chronicle a remarkable chain of circumstances led from the apparently trivial incidents which first attracted poirots attention to the sinister happenings which completed a most unusual case i had been spending the evening with an old friend of mine gerald parker there had been perhaps about half a dozen people there besides my host and myself and the talk fell as it was bound to do sooner or later wherever parker found himself on the subject of househunting in london houses and flats were parkers special hobby since the end of the war he had occupied at least half a dozen different flats and maisonnettes no sooner was he settled anywhere than he would light unexpectedly upon a new find and would forthwith depart bag and baggage his moves were nearly always accomplished at a slight pecuniary gain for he had a shrewd business head but it was sheer love of the sport that actuated him and not a desire to make money at it we listened to parker for some time with the respect of the novice for the expert then it was our turn and a perfect babel of tongues was let loose finally the floor was left to mrs robinson a charming little bride who was there with her husband i had never met them before as robinson was only a recent acquaintance of parkers talking of flats she said have you heard of our piece of luck mr parker weve got a flatat last in montagu mansions well said parker ive always said there are plenty of flatsat a price yes but this isnt at a price its dirt cheap eighty pounds a year butbut montagu mansions is just off knightsbridge isnt it big handsome building or are you talking of a poor relation of the same name stuck in the slums somewhere no its the knightsbridge one thats what makes it so wonderful wonderful is the word its a blinking miracle but there must be a catch somewhere big premium i suppose no premium no premoh hold my head somebody groaned parker but weve got to buy the furniture continued mrs robinson ah parker brisked up i knew there was a catch for fifty pounds and its beautifully furnished i give it up said parker the present occupants must be lunatics with a taste for philanthropy mrs robinson was looking a little troubled a little pucker appeared between her dainty brows it is queer isnt it you dont think thatthatthe place is haunted never heard of a haunted flat declared parker decisively no mrs robinson appeared far from convinced but there were several things about it all that struck me aswell queer for instance i suggested ah said parker our criminal experts attention is aroused unburden yourself to him mrs robinson hastings is a great unraveller of mysteries i laughed embarrassed but not wholly displeased with the rle thrust upon me oh not really queer captain hastings but when we went to the agents stosser and paulwe hadnt tried them before because they only have the expensive mayfair flats but we thought at any rate it would do no harmeverything they offered us was four and five hundred a year or else huge premiums and then just as we were going they mentioned that they had a flat at eighty but that they doubted if it would be any good our going there because it had been on their books some time and they had sent so many people to see it that it was almost sure to be takensnapped up as the clerk put itonly people were so tiresome in not letting them know and then they went on sending and people get annoyed at being sent to a place that had perhaps been let some time mrs robinson paused for some much needed breath and then continued we thanked him and said that we quite understood it would probably be no good but that we should like an order all the samejust in case and we went there straight away in a taxi for after all you never know no  was on the second floor and just as we were waiting for the lift elsie fergusonshes a friend of mine captain hastings and they are looking for a flat toocame hurrying down the stairs ahead of you for once my dear she said but its no good its already let that seemed to finish it butwell as john said the place was very cheap we could afford to give more and perhaps if we offered a premiuma horrid thing to do of course and i feel quite ashamed of telling you but you know what flathunting is i assured her that i was well aware that in the struggle for houseroom the baser side of human nature frequently triumphed over the higher and that the wellknown rule of dog eat dog always applied so we went up and would you believe it the flat wasnt let at all we were shown over it by the maid and then we saw the mistress and the thing was settled then and there immediate possession and fifty pounds for the furniture we signed the agreement next day and we are to move in tomorrow mrs robinson paused triumphantly and what about mrs ferguson asked parker lets have your deductions hastings obvious my dear watson i quoted lightly she went to the wrong flat oh captain hastings how clever of you cried mrs robinson admiringly i rather wished poirot had been there sometimes i have the feeling that he rather underestimates my capabilities                      the whole thing was rather amusing and i propounded the thing as a mock problem to poirot on the following morning he seemed interested and questioned me rather narrowly as to the rents of flats in various localities a curious story he said thoughtfully excuse me hastings i must take a short stroll when he returned about an hour later his eyes were gleaming with a peculiar excitement he laid his stick on the table and brushed the nap of his hat with his usual tender care before he spoke it is as well mon ami that we have no affairs of moment on hand we can devote ourselves wholly to the present investigation what investigation are you talking about the remarkable cheapness of your friends mrs robinsons new flat poirot you are not serious i am most serious figure to yourself my friend that the real rent of those flats is  i have just ascertained that from the landlords agents and yet this particular flat is being sublet at eighty pounds why there must be something wrong with it perhaps it is haunted as mrs robinson suggested poirot shook his head in a dissatisfied manner then again how curious it is that her friend tells her the flat is let and when she goes up behold it is not so at all but surely you agree with me that the other woman must have gone to the wrong flat that is the only possible solution you may or may not be right on that point hastings the fact still remains that numerous other applicants were sent to see it and yet in spite of its remarkable cheapness it was still in the market when mrs robinson arrived that shows that there must be something wrong about it mrs robinson did not seem to notice anything amiss very curious is it not did she impress you as being a truthful woman hastings she was a delightful creature videmment since she renders you incapable of replying to my question describe her to me then well shes tall and fair her hairs really a beautiful shade of auburn always you have had a penchant for auburn hair murmured poirot but continue blue eyes and a very nice complexion andwell thats all i think i concluded lamely and her husband oh hes quite a nice fellownothing startling dark or fair i dont knowbetwixt and between and just an ordinary sort of face poirot nodded yes there are hundreds of these average menand anyway you bring more sympathy and appreciation to your description of women do you know anything about these people does parker know them well they are just recent acquaintances i believe but surely poirot you dont think for an instant poirot raised his hand tout doucement mon ami have i said that i think anything all i say isit is a curious story and there is nothing to throw light upon it except perhaps the ladys name eh hastings her name is stella i said stiffly but i dont see poirot interrupted me with a tremendous chuckle something seemed to be amusing him vastly and stella means a star does it not famous what on earth and stars give light voil calm yourself hastings do not put on that air of injured dignity come we will go to montagu mansions and make a few inquiries i accompanied him nothing loath the mansions were a handsome block of buildings in excellent repair a uniformed porter was sunning himself on the threshold and it was to him that poirot addressed himself pardon but could you tell me if a mr and mrs robinson reside here the porter was a man of few words and apparently of a sour or suspicious disposition he hardly looked at us and grunted out no  second floor i thank you can you tell me how long they have been here six months i started forward in amazement conscious as i did so of poirots malicious grin impossible i cried you must be making a mistake six months are you sure the lady i mean is tall and fair with reddish gold hair and thats er said the porter come in the michaelmas quarter they did just six months ago he appeared to lose interest in us and retreated slowly up the hall i followed poirot outside eh bien hastings my friend demanded slyly are you so sure now that delightful women always speak the truth i did not reply poirot had steered his way into brompton road before i asked him what he was going to do and where we were going to the house agents hastings i have a great desire to have a flat in montagu mansions if i am not mistaken several interesting things will take place there before long we were fortunate in our quest no  on the fourth floor was to be let furnished at ten guineas a week poirot promptly took it for a month outside in the street again he silenced my protests but i make money nowadays why should i not indulge a whim by the way hastings have you a revolver yessomewhere i answered slightly thrilled do you think that you will need it it is quite possible the idea pleases you i see always the spectacular and romantic appeals to you the following day saw us installed in our temporary home the flat was pleasantly furnished it occupied the same position in the building as that of the robinsons but was two floors higher the day after our installation was a sunday in the afternoon poirot left the front door ajar and summoned me hastily as a bang reverberated from somewhere below look over the banisters are those your friends do not let them see you i craned my neck over the staircase thats them i declared in an ungrammatical whisper good wait awhile about half an hour later a young woman emerged in brilliant and varied clothing with a sigh of satisfaction poirot tiptoed back into the flat cest a after the master and mistress the maid the flat should now be empty what are we going to do i asked uneasily poirot had trotted briskly into the scullery and was hauling at the rope of the coallift we are about to descend after the method of the dustbins he explained cheerfully no one will observe us the sunday concert the sunday afternoon out and finally the sunday nap after the sunday dinner of englandle rosbifall these will distract attention from the doings of hercule poirot come my friend he stepped into the rough wooden contrivance and i followed him gingerly are we going to break into the flat i asked dubiously poirots answer was not too reassuring not precisely today he replied pulling on the rope we descended slowly till we reached the second floor poirot uttered an exclamation of satisfaction as he perceived that the wooden door into the scullery was open you observe never do they bolt these doors in the daytime and yet anyone could mount or descend as we have done at night yesthough not always thenand it is against that that we are going to make provision he had drawn some tools from his pocket as he spoke and at once set deftly to work his object being to arrange the bolt so that it could be pulled back from the lift the operation only occupied about three minutes then poirot returned the tools to his pocket and we reascended once more to our own domain                      on monday poirot was out all day but when he returned in the evening he flung himself into his chair with a sigh of satisfaction hastings shall i recount to you a little history a story after your own heart and which will remind you of your favourite cinema go ahead i laughed i presume that it is a true story not one of your efforts of fancy it is true enough inspector japp of scotland yard will vouch for its accuracy since it was through his kind offices that it came to my ears listen hastings a little over six months ago some important naval plans were stolen from an american government department they showed the position of some of the most important harbour defences and would be worth a considerable sum to any foreign governmentthat of japan for example suspicion fell upon a young man named luigi valdarno an italian by birth who was employed in a minor capacity in the department and who was missing at the same time as the papers whether luigi valdarno was the thief or not he was found two days later on the east side in new york shot dead the papers were not on him now for some time past luigi valdarno had been going about with a miss elsa hardt a young concert singer who had recently appeared and who lived with a brother in an apartment in washington nothing was known of the antecedents of miss elsa hardt and she disappeared suddenly about the time of valdarnos death there are reasons for believing that she was in reality an accomplished international spy who has done much nefarious work under various aliases the american secret service whilst doing their best to trace her also kept an eye upon certain insignificant japanese gentlemen living in washington they felt pretty certain that when elsa hardt had covered her tracks sufficiently she would approach the gentlemen in question one of them left suddenly for england a fortnight ago on the face of it therefore it would seem that elsa hardt is in england poirot paused and then added softly the official description of elsa hardt is height  ft  eyes blue hair auburn fair complexion nose straight no special distinguishing marks mrs robinson i gasped well there is a chance of it anyhow amended poirot also i learn that a swarthy man a foreigner of some kind was inquiring about the occupants of no  only this morning therefore mon ami i fear that you must forswear your beauty sleep tonight and join me in my allnight vigil in the flat belowarmed with that excellent revolver of yours bien entendu rather i cried with enthusiasm when shall we start the hour of midnight is both solemn and suitable i fancy nothing is likely to occur before then at twelve oclock precisely we crept cautiously into the coallift and lowered ourselves to the second floor under poirots manipulation the wooden door quickly swung inwards and we climbed into the flat from the scullery we passed into the kitchen where we established ourselves comfortably in two chairs with the door into the hall ajar now we have but to wait said poirot contentedly closing his eyes to me the waiting appeared endless i was terrified of going to sleep just when it seemed to me that i had been there about eight hoursand had as i found out afterwards in reality been exactly one hour and twenty minutesa faint scratching sound came to my ears poirots hand touched mine i rose and together we moved carefully in the direction of the hall the noise came from there poirot placed his lips to my ear outside the front door they are cutting out the lock when i give the word not before fall upon him from behind and hold him fast be careful he will have a knife presently there was a rending sound and a little circle of light appeared through the door it was extinguished immediately and then the door was slowly opened poirot and i flattened ourselves against the wall i heard a mans breathing as he passed us then he flashed on his torch and as he did so poirot hissed in my ear allez we sprang together poirot with a quick movement enveloped the intruders head with a light woollen scarf whilst i pinioned his arms the whole affair was quick and noiseless i twisted a dagger from his hand and as poirot brought down the scarf from his eyes whilst keeping it wound tightly round his mouth i jerked up my revolver where he could see it and understand that resistance was useless as he ceased to struggle poirot put his mouth close to his ear and began to whisper rapidly after a minute the man nodded then enjoining silence with a movement of the hand poirot led the way out of the flat and down the stairs our captive followed and i brought up the rear with the revolver when we were out in the street poirot turned to me there is a taxi waiting just round the corner give me the revolver we shall not need it now but if this fellow tries to escape poirot smiled he will not i returned in a minute with the waiting taxi the scarf had been unwound from the strangers face and i gave a start of surprise hes not a jap i ejaculated in a whisper to poirot observation was always your strong point hastings nothing escapes you no the man is not a jap he is an italian we got into the taxi and poirot gave the driver an address in st johns wood i was by now completely fogged i did not like to ask poirot where we were going in front of our captive and strove in vain to obtain some light upon the proceedings we alighted at the door of a small house standing back from the road a returning wayfarer slightly drunk was lurching along the pavement and almost collided with poirot who said something sharply to him which i did not catch all three of us went up the steps of the house poirot rang the bell and motioned us to stand a little aside there was no answer and he rang again and then seized the knocker which he plied for some minutes vigorously a light appeared suddenly above the fanlight and the door was opened cautiously a little way what the devil do you want a mans voice demanded harshly i want the doctor my wife is taken ill theres no doctor here the man prepared to shut the door but poirot thrust his foot in adroitly he became suddenly a perfect caricature of an infuriated frenchman what you say there is no doctor i will have the law of you you must come i will stay here and ring and knock all night my dear sir the door was opened again the man clad in a dressinggown and slippers stepped forward to pacify poirot with an uneasy glance round i will call the police poirot prepared to descend the steps no dont do that for heavens sake the man dashed after him with a neat push poirot sent him staggering down the steps in another minute all three of us were inside the door and it was pushed to and bolted quickin here poirot led the way into the nearest room switching on the light as he did so and youbehind the curtain si signor said the italian and slid rapidly behind the full folds of rosecoloured velvet which draped the embrasure of the window not a minute too soon just as he disappeared from view a woman rushed into the room she was tall with reddish hair and held a scarlet kimono round her slender form where is my husband she cried with a quick frightened glance who are you poirot stepped forward with a bow it is to be hoped your husband will not suffer from a chill i observed that he had slippers on his feet and that his dressinggown was a warm one who are you what are you doing in my house it is true that none of us have the pleasure of your acquaintance madame it is especially to be regretted as one of our number has come specially from new york in order to meet you the curtains parted and the italian stepped out to my horror i observed that he was brandishing my revolver which poirot must doubtless have put down through inadvertence in the cab the woman gave a piercing scream and turned to fly but poirot was standing in front of the closed door let me by she shrieked he will murder me who was it dat croaked luigi valdarno asked the italian hoarsely brandishing the weapon and sweeping each one of us with it we dared not move my god poirot this is awful what shall we do i cried you will oblige me by refraining from talking so much hastings i can assure you that our friend will not shoot until i give the word youse sure o dat eh said the italian leering unpleasantly it was more than i was but the woman turned to poirot like a flash what is it you want poirot bowed i do not think it is necessary to insult miss elsa hardts intelligence by telling her with a swift movement the woman snatched up a big black velvet cat which served as a cover for the telephone they are stitched in the lining of that clever murmured poirot appreciatively he stood aside from the door good evening madame i will detain your friend from new york whilst you make your getaway whatta fool roared the big italian and raising the revolver he fired pointblank at the womans retreating figure just as i flung myself upon him but the weapon merely clicked harmlessly and poirots voice rose in mild reproof never will you trust your old friend hastings i do not care for my friends to carry loaded pistols about with them and never would i permit a mere acquaintance to do so no no mon ami this to the italian who swearing hoarsely poirot continued to address him in a tone of mild reproof see now what i have done for you i have saved you from being hanged and do not think that our beautiful lady will escape no no the house is watched back and front straight into the arms of the police they will go is not that a beautiful and consoling thought yes you may leave the room now but be carefulbe very careful iah he is gone and my friend hastings looks at me with eyes of reproach but it was all so simple it was clear from the first that out of several hundred probably applicants for no  montagu mansions only the robinsons were considered suitable why what was there that singled them out from the restat practically a glance their appearance possibly but it was not so unusual their name then but theres nothing unusual about the name of robinson i cried its quite a common name ah sapristi but exactly that was the point elsa hardt and her husband or brother or whatever he really is come from new york and take a flat in the name of mr and mrs robinson suddenly they learn that one of these secret societies the mafia or the camorra to which doubtless luigi valdarno belonged is on their track what do they do they hit on a scheme of transparent simplicity evidently they knew that their pursuers were not personally acquainted with either of them what then can be simpler they offer the flat at an absurdly low rental of the thousands of young couples in london looking for flats there cannot fail to be several robinsons it is only a matter of waiting if you will look at the name of robinson in the telephone directory you will realize that a fairhaired mrs robinson was pretty sure to come along sooner or later then what will happen the avenger arrives he knows the name he knows the address he strikes all is over vengeance is satisfied and miss elsa hardt has escaped by the skin of her teeth once more by the way hastings you must present me to the real mrs robinsonthat delightful and truthful creature what will they think when they find their flat has been broken into we must hurry back ah that sounds like japp and his friends arriving a mighty tattoo sounded on the knocker how did you know this address i asked as i followed poirot out into the hall oh of course you had the first mrs robinson followed when she left the other flat a la bonne heure hastings you use your grey cells at last now for a little surprise for japp softly unbolting the door he stuck the cats head round the edge and ejaculated a piercing miaow the scotland yard inspector who was standing outside with another man jumped in spite of himself oh its only monsieur poirot at one of his little jokes he exclaimed as poirots head followed that of the cat let us in moosior you have our friends safe and sound yes weve got the birds all right but they hadnt got the goods with them i see so you come to search well i am about to depart with hastings but i should like to give you a little lecture upon the history and habits of the domestic cat for the lords sake have you gone completely balmy the cat declaimed poirot was worshipped by the ancient egyptians it is still regarded as a symbol of good luck if a black cat crosses your path this cat crossed your path tonight japp to speak of the interior of any animal or any person is not i know considered polite in england but the interior of this cat is perfectly delicate i refer to the lining with a sudden grunt the second man seized the cat from poirots hand oh i forgot to introduce you said japp mr poirot this is mr burt of the united states secret service the americans trained fingers had felt what he was looking for he held out his hand and for a moment speech failed him then he rose to the occasion pleased to meet you said mr burt   iv   the mystery of hunters lodge after all murmured poirot it is possible that i shall not die this time coming from a convalescent influenza patient i hailed the remark as showing a beneficial optimism i myself had been the first sufferer from the disease poirot in his turn had gone down he was now sitting up in bed propped up with pillows his head muffled in a woollen shawl and was slowly sipping a particularly noxious tisane which i had prepared according to his directions his eye rested with pleasure upon a neatly graduated row of medicine bottles which adorned the mantelpiece yes yes my little friend continued once more shall i be myself again the great hercule poirot the terror of evildoers figure to yourself mon ami that i have a little paragraph to myself in society gossip but yes here it is go itcriminalsall out hercule poirotand believe me girls hes some herculesour own pet society detective cant get a grip on you cause why cause hes got la grippe himself i laughed good for you poirot you are becoming quite a public character and fortunately you havent missed anything of particular interest during this time that is true the few cases i have had to decline did not fill me with any regret our landlady stuck her head in at the door theres a gentleman downstairs says he must see monsieur poirot or you captain seeing as he was in a great todoand with all that quite the gentlemani brought up is card she handed me the bit of pasteboard mr roger havering i read poirot motioned with his head towards the bookcase and i obediently pulled forth whos who poirot took it from me and scanned the pages rapidly second son of fifth baron windsor married  zoe fourth daughter of william crabb hm i said i rather fancy thats the girl who used to act at the frivolityonly she called herself zoe carrisbrook i remember she married some young man about town just before the war would it interest you hastings to go down and hear what our visitors particular little trouble is make him all my excuses roger havering was a man of about forty well set up and of smart appearance his face however was haggard and he was evidently labouring under great agitation captain hastings you are monsieur poirots partner i understand it is imperative that he should come with me to derbyshire today im afraid thats impossible i replied poirot is ill in bedinfluenza his face fell dear me that is a great blow to me the matter on which you want to consult him is serious my god yes my uncle the best friend i have in the world was foully murdered last night here in london no in derbyshire i was in town and received a telegram from my wife this morning immediately upon its receipt i determined to come round and beg monsieur poirot to undertake the case if you will excuse me a minute i said struck by a sudden idea i rushed upstairs and in a few brief words acquainted poirot with the situation he took any further words out of my mouth i see i see you want to go yourself is it not so well why not you should know my methods by now all i ask is that you should report to me fully every day and follow implicitly any instructions i may wire you to this i willingly agreed                      an hour later i was sitting opposite mr havering in a firstclass carriage on the midland railway speeding rapidly away from london to begin with captain hastings you must understand that hunters lodge where we are going and where the tragedy took place is only a small shootingbox in the heart of the derbyshire moors our real home is near newmarket and we usually rent a flat in town for the season hunters lodge is looked after by a housekeeper who is quite capable of doing all we need when we run down for an occasional weekend of course during the shooting season we take down some of our own servants from newmarket my uncle mr harrington pace as you may know my mother was a miss pace of new york has for the last three years made his home with us he never got on well with my father or my elder brother and i suspect that my being somewhat of a prodigal son myself rather increased than diminished his affection towards me of course i am a poor man and my uncle was a rich onein other words he paid the piper but though exacting in many ways he was not really hard to get on with and we all three lived very harmoniously together two days ago my uncle rather wearied with some recent gaieties of ours in town suggested that we should run down to derbyshire for a day or two my wife telegraphed to mrs middleton the housekeeper and we went down that same afternoon yesterday evening i was forced to return to town but my wife and my uncle remained on this morning i received this telegram he handed it over to me come at once uncle harrington murdered last night bring good detective if you can but do comezoe then as yet you know no details no i suppose it will be in the evening papers without doubt the police are in charge it was about three oclock when we arrived at the little station of elmers dale from there a fivemile drive brought us to a small grey stone building in the midst of the rugged moors a lonely place i observed with a shiver havering nodded i shall try and get rid of it i could never live here again we unlatched the gate and were walking up the narrow path to the oak door when a familiar figure emerged and came to meet us japp i ejaculated the scotland yard inspector grinned at me in a friendly fashion before addressing my companion mr havering i think ive been sent down from london to take charge of this case and id like a word with you if i may sir my wife ive seen your good lady sirand the housekeeper i wont keep you a moment but im anxious to get back to the village now that ive seen all there is to see here i know nothing as yet as to what exactly said japp soothingly but there are just one or two little points id like your opinion about all the same captain hastings here he knows me and hell go on up to the house and tell them youre coming what have you done with the little man by the way captain hastings hes ill in bed with influenza is he now im sorry to hear that rather the case of the cart without the horse your being here without him isnt it and on his rather illtimed jest i went on to the house i rang the bell as japp had closed the door behind him after some moments it was opened to me by a middleaged woman in black mr havering will be here in a moment i explained he has been detained by the inspector i have come down with him from london to look into the case perhaps you can tell me briefly what occurred last night come inside sir she closed the door behind me and we stood in the dimlylighted hall it was after dinner last night sir that the man came he asked to see mr pace sir and seeing that he spoke the same way i thought it was an american gentleman friend of mr paces and i showed him into the gunroom and then went to tell mr pace he wouldnt give any name which of course was a bit odd now i come to think of it i told mr pace and he seemed puzzled like but he said to the mistress excuse me zoe while i just see what this fellow wants he went off to the gunroom and i went back to the kitchen but after a while i heard loud voices as if they were quarrelling and i came out into the hall at the same time the mistress she comes out too and just then there was a shot and then a dreadful silence we both ran to the gunroom door but it was locked and we had to go round to the window it was open and there inside was mr pace all shot and bleeding what became of the man he must have got away through the window sir before we got to it and then mrs havering sent me to fetch the police five miles to walk it was they came back with me and the constable he stayed all night and this morning the police gentleman from london arrived what was this man like who called to see mr pace the housekeeper reflected he had a black beard sir and was about middleaged and had on a light overcoat beyond the fact that he spoke like an american i didnt notice much about him i see now i wonder if i can see mrs havering shes upstairs sir shall i tell her if you please tell her that mr havering is outside with inspector japp and that the gentleman he has brought back with him from london is anxious to speak to her as soon as possible very good sir i was in a fever of impatience to get at all the facts japp had two or three hours start of me and his anxiety to be gone made me keen to be close at his heels mrs havering did not keep me waiting long in a few minutes i heard a light step descending the stairs and looked up to see a very handsome young woman coming towards me she wore a flamecoloured jumper that set off the slender boyishness of her figure on her dark head was a little hat of flamecoloured leather even the present tragedy could not dim the vitality of her personality i introduced myself and she nodded in quick comprehension of course i have often heard of you and your colleague monsieur poirot you have done some wonderful things together havent you it was very clever of my husband to get you so promptly now will you ask me questions that is the easiest way isnt it of getting to know all you want to about this dreadful affair thank you mrs havering now what time was it that this man arrived it must have been just before nine oclock we had finished dinner and were sitting over our coffee and cigarettes your husband had already left for london yes he went up by the  did he go by car to the station or did he walk our own car isnt down here one came out from the garage in elmers dale to fetch him in time for the train was mr pace quite his usual self absolutely most normal in every way now can you describe this visitor at all im afraid not i didnt see him mrs middleton showed him straight into the gunroom and then came to tell my uncle what did your uncle say he seemed rather annoyed but went off at once it was about five minutes later that i heard the sound of raised voices i ran out into the hall and almost collided with mrs middleton then we heard the shot the gunroom door was locked on the inside and we had to go right round the house to the window of course that took some time and the murderer had been able to get well away my poor uncleher voice falteredhad been shot through the head i saw at once that he was dead i sent mrs middleton for the police i was careful to touch nothing in the room but to leave it exactly as i found it i nodded approval now as to the weapon well i can make a guess at it captain hastings a pair of revolvers of my husbands were mounted upon the wall one of them is missing i pointed this out to the police and they took the other one away with them when they have extracted the bullet i suppose they will know for certain may i go to the gunroom certainly the police have finished with it but the body has been removed she accompanied me to the scene of the crime at that moment havering entered the hall and with a quick apology his wife ran to him i was left to undertake my investigations alone i may as well confess at once that they were rather disappointing in detective novels clues abound but here i could find nothing that struck me as out of the ordinary except a large bloodstain on the carpet where i judged the dead man had fallen i examined everything with painstaking care and took a couple of pictures of the room with my little camera which i had brought with me i also examined the ground outside the window but it appeared to have been so heavily trampled underfoot that i judged it was useless to waste time over it no i had seen all that hunters lodge had to show me i must go back to elmers dale and get into touch with japp accordingly i took leave of the haverings and was driven off in the car that had brought us up from the station i found japp at the matlock arms and he took me forthwith to see the body harrington pace was a small spare cleanshaven man typically american in appearance he had been shot through the back of the head and the revolver had been discharged at close quarters turned away for a moment remarked japp and the other fellow snatched up a revolver and shot him the one mrs havering handed over to us was fully loaded and i suppose the other one was also curious what darn fool things people do fancy keeping two loaded revolvers hanging up on your wall what do you think of the case i asked as we left the gruesome chamber behind us well id got my eye on havering to begin with oh yes noting my exclamation of astonishment havering has one or two shady incidents in his past when he was a boy at oxford there was some funny business about the signature on one of his fathers cheques all hushed up of course then hes pretty heavily in debt now and theyre the kind of debts he wouldnt like to go to his uncle about whereas you may be sure the uncles will would be in his favour yes id got my eye on him and thats why i wanted to speak to him before he saw his wife but their statements dovetail all right and ive been to the station and theres no doubt whatever that he left by the  that gets up to london about  he went straight to his club he says and if thats confirmed all rightwhy he couldnt have been shooting his uncle here at nine oclock in a black beard ah yes i was going to ask you what you thought about that beard japp winked i think it grew pretty fastgrew in the five miles from elmers dale to hunters lodge americans that ive met are mostly cleanshaven yes its amongst mr paces american associates that well have to look for the murderer i questioned the housekeeper first and then her mistress and their stories agree all right but im sorry mrs havering didnt get a look at the fellow shes a smart woman and she might have noticed something that would set us on the track i sat down and wrote a minute and lengthy account to poirot i was able to add various further items of information before i posted the letter the bullet had been extracted and was proved to have been fired from a revolver identical with the one held by the police furthermore mr haverings movements on the night in question had been checked and verified and it was proved beyond doubt that he had actually arrived in london by the train in question and thirdly a sensational development had occurred a city gentleman living at ealing on crossing haven green to get to the district railway station that morning had observed a brownpaper parcel stuck between the railings opening it he found that it contained a revolver he handed the parcel over to the local police station and before night it was proved to be the one we were in search of the fellow to that given us by mrs havering one bullet had been fired from it all this i added to my report a wire from poirot arrived whilst i was at breakfast the following morning of course black bearded man was not havering only you or japp would have such an idea wire me description of housekeeper and what clothes she wore this morning same of mrs havering do not waste time taking photographs of interiors they are underexposed and not in the least artistic it seemed to me that poirots style was unnecessarily facetious i also fancied he was a shade jealous of my position on the spot with full facilities for handling the case his request for a description of the clothes worn by the two women appeared to me to be simply ridiculous but i complied as well as i a mere man was able to at eleven a reply wire came from poirot advise japp arrest housekeeper before it is too late dumbfounded i took the wire to japp he swore softly under his breath hes the goods monsieur poirot if he says so theres something in it and i hardly noticed the woman i dont know that i can go so far as arresting her but ill have her watched well go up right away and take another look at her but it was too late mrs middleton that quiet middleaged woman who had appeared so normal and respectable had vanished into thin air her box had been left behind it contained only ordinary wearing apparel there was no clue in it to her identity or as to her whereabouts from mrs havering we elicited all the facts we could i engaged her about three weeks ago when mrs emery our former housekeeper left she came to me from mrs selbournes agency in mount streeta very wellknown place i get all my servants from there they sent several women to see me but this mrs middleton seemed much the nicest and had splendid references i engaged her on the spot and notified the agency of the fact i cant believe that there was anything wrong with her she was such a nice quiet woman the thing was certainly a mystery whilst it was clear that the woman herself could not have committed the crime since at the moment the shot was fired mrs havering was with her in the hall nevertheless she must have some connection with the murder or why should she suddenly take to her heels and bolt i wired the latest development to poirot and suggested returning to london and making inquiries at selbournes agency poirots reply was prompt useless to inquire at agency they will never have heard of her find out what vehicle took her up to hunters lodge when she first arrived there though mystified i was obedient the means of transport in elmers dale were limited the local garage had two battered ford cars and there were two station flies none of these had been requisitioned on the date in question questioned mrs havering explained that she had given the woman the money for her fare down to derbyshire and sufficient to hire a car or fly to take her up to hunters lodge there was usually one of the fords at the station on the chance of its being required taking into consideration the further fact that nobody at the station had noticed the arrival of a stranger blackbearded or otherwise on the fatal evening everything seemed to point to the conclusion that the murderer had come to the spot in a car which had been waiting near at hand to aid his escape and that the same car had brought the mysterious housekeeper to her new post i may mention that inquiries at the agency in london bore out poirots prognostication no such woman as mrs middleton had ever been on their books they had received the hon mrs haverings application for a housekeeper and had sent her various applicants for the post when she sent them the engagement fee she omitted to mention which woman she had selected somewhat crestfallen i returned to london i found poirot established in an armchair by the fire in a garish silk dressinggown he greeted me with much affection mon ami hastings but how glad i am to see you veritably i have for you a great affection and you have enjoyed yourself you have run to and fro with the good japp you have interrogated and investigated to your hearts content poirot i cried the things a dark mystery it will never be solved it is true that we are not likely to cover ourselves with glory over it no indeed its a hard nut to crack oh as far as that goes i am very good at cracking the nuts a veritable squirrel it is not that which embarrasses me i know well enough who killed mr harrington pace you know how did you find out your illuminating answers to my wires supplied me with the truth see here hastings let us examine the facts methodically and in order mr harrington pace is a man with a considerable fortune which at his death will doubtless pass to his nephew point no  his nephew is known to be desperately hard up point no  his nephew is also known to beshall we say a man of rather loose moral fibre point no  but roger havering is proved to have journeyed straight up to london prcismentand therefore as mr havering left elmers dale at  and since mr pace cannot have been killed before he left or the doctor would have spotted the time of the crime as being given wrongly when he examined the body we conclude quite rightly that mr havering did not shoot his uncle but there is a mrs havering hastings impossible the housekeeper was with her when the shot was fired ah yes the housekeeper but she has disappeared she will be found i think not there is something peculiarly elusive about that housekeeper dont you think so hastings it struck me at once she played her part i suppose and then got out in the nick of time and what was her part well presumably to admit her confederate the blackbearded man oh no that was not her part her part was what you have just mentioned to provide an alibi for mrs havering at the moment the shot was fired and no one will ever find her mon ami because she does not exist theres no sech person as your so great shakespeare says it was dickens i murmured unable to suppress a smile but what do you mean poirot i mean that zoe havering was an actress before her marriage that you and japp only saw the housekeeper in a dark hall a dim middleaged figure in black with a faint subdued voice and finally that neither you nor japp nor the local police whom the housekeeper fetched ever saw mrs middleton and her mistress at one and the same time it was childs play for that clever and daring woman on the pretext of summoning her mistress she runs upstairs slips on a bright jumper and a hat with black curls attached which she jams down over the grey transformation a few deft touches and the makeup is removed a slight dusting of rouge and the brilliant zoe havering comes down with her clear ringing voice nobody looks particularly at the housekeeper why should they there is nothing to connect her with the crime she too has an alibi but the revolver that was found at ealing mrs havering could not have placed it there no that was roger haverings jobbut it was a mistake on their part it put me on the right track a man who has committed a murder with a revolver which he found on the spot would fling it away at once he would not carry it up to london with him no the motive was clear the criminals wished to focus the interest of the police on a spot far removed from derbyshire they were anxious to get the police away as soon as possible from the vicinity of hunters lodge of course the revolver found at ealing was not the one with which mr pace was shot roger havering discharged one shot from it brought it up to london went straight to his club to establish his alibi then went quickly out to ealing by the district a matter of about twenty minutes only placed the parcel where it was found and so back to town that charming creature his wife quietly shoots mr pace after dinneryou remember he was shot from behind another significant point thatreloads the revolver and puts it back in its place and then starts off with her desperate little comedy its incredible i murmured fascinated and yet and yet it is true bien sur my friend it is true but to bring that precious pair to justice that is another matter well japp must do what he cani have written him fullybut i very much fear hastings that we shall be obliged to leave them to fate or le bon dieu whichever you prefer the wicked flourish like a green bay tree i reminded him but at a price hastings always at a price croyezmoi poirots forebodings were confirmed japp though convinced of the truth of his theory was unable to get together the necessary evidence to ensure a conviction mr paces huge fortune passed into the hands of his murderers nevertheless nemesis did overtake them and when i read in the paper that the hon roger and mrs havering were amongst those killed in the crashing of the air mail to paris i knew that justice was satisfied   v   the million dollar bond robbery what a number of bond robberies there have been lately i observed one morning laying aside the newspaper poirot let us forsake the science of detection and take to crime instead you are on thehow do you say itgetrichquick tack eh mon ami well look at this last coup the million dollars worth of liberty bonds which the london and scottish bank were sending to new york and which disappeared in such a remarkable manner on board the olympia if it were not for the mal de mer and the difficulty of practising the so excellent method of laverguier for a longer time than the few hours of crossing the channel i should delight to voyage myself on one of these big liners murmured poirot dreamily yes indeed i said enthusiastically some of them must be perfect palaces the swimmingbaths the lounges the restaurant the palm courtsreally it must be hard to believe that one is on the sea me i always know when i am on the sea said poirot sadly and all those bagatelles that you enumerate they say nothing to me but my friend consider for a moment the geniuses that travel as it were incognito on board these floating palaces as you so justly call them one would meet the lite the haute noblesse of the criminal world i laughed so thats the way your enthusiasm runs you would have liked to cross swords with the man who sneaked the liberty bonds the landlady interrupted us a young lady as wants to see you mr poirot heres her card the card bore the inscription miss esme farquhar and poirot after diving under the table to retrieve a stray crumb and putting it carefully in the wastepaperbasket nodded to the landlady to admit her in another minute one of the most charming girls i have ever seen was ushered into the room she was perhaps about fiveandtwenty with big brown eyes and a perfect figure she was welldressed and perfectly composed in manner sit down i beg of you mademoiselle this is my friend captain hastings who aids me in my little problems i am afraid it is a big problem i have brought you today monsieur poirot said the girl giving me a pleasant bow as she seated herself i dare say you have read about it in the papers i am referring to the theft of liberty bonds on the olympia some astonishment must have shown itself in poirots face for she continued quickly you are doubtless asking yourself what i have to do with a grave institution like the london and scottish bank in one sense nothing in another sense everything you see monsieur poirot i am engaged to mr philip ridgeway aha and mr philip ridgeway was in charge of the bonds when they were stolen of course no actual blame can attach to him it was not his fault in any way nevertheless he is half distraught over the matter and his uncle i know insists that he must carelessly have mentioned having them in his possession it is a terrible setback in his career who is his uncle mr vavasour joint general manager of the london and scottish bank suppose miss farquhar that you recount to me the whole story very well as you know the bank wished to extend their credits in america and for this purpose decided to send over a million dollars in liberty bonds mr vavasour selected his nephew who had occupied a position of trust in the bank for many years and who was conversant with all the details of the banks dealings in new york to make the trip the olympia sailed from liverpool on the rd and the bonds were handed over to philip on the morning of that day by mr vavasour and mr shaw the two joint general managers of the london and scottish bank they were counted enclosed in a package and sealed in his presence and he then locked the package at once in his portmanteau a portmanteau with an ordinary lock no mr shaw insisted on a special lock being fitted to it by hubbss philip as i say placed the package at the bottom of the trunk it was stolen just a few hours before reaching new york a rigorous search of the whole ship was made but without result the bonds seemed literally to have vanished into thin air poirot made a grimace but they did not vanish absolutely since i gather that they were sold in small parcels within half an hour of the docking of the olympia well undoubtedly the next thing is for me to see mr ridgeway i was about to suggest that you should lunch with me at the cheshire cheese philip will be there he is meeting me but does not yet know that i have been consulting you on his behalf we agreed to this suggestion readily enough and drove there in a taxi mr philip ridgeway was there before us and looked somewhat surprised to see his fiance arriving with two complete strangers he was a nicelooking young fellow tall and spruce with a touch of greying hair at the temples though he could not have been much over thirty miss farquhar went up to him and laid her hand on his arm you must forgive my acting without consulting you philip she said let me introduce you to monsieur hercule poirot of whom you must often have heard and his friend captain hastings ridgeway looked very astonished of course i have heard of you monsieur poirot he said as he shook hands but i had no idea that esme was thinking of consulting you about myour trouble i was afraid you would not let me do it philip said miss farquhar meekly so you took care to be on the safe side he observed with a smile i hope monsieur poirot will be able to throw some light on this extraordinary puzzle for i confess frankly that i am nearly out of my mind with worry and anxiety about it indeed his face looked drawn and haggard and showed only too clearly the strain under which he was labouring well well said poirot let us lunch and over lunch we will put our heads together and see what can be done i want to hear mr ridgeways story from his own lips whilst we discussed the excellent steak and kidney pudding of the establishment philip ridgeway narrated the circumstances leading to the disappearance of the bonds his story agreed with that of miss farquhar in every particular when he had finished poirot took up the thread with a question what exactly led you to discover that the bonds had been stolen mr ridgeway he laughed rather bitterly the thing stared me in the face monsieur poirot i couldnt have missed it my cabin trunk was half out from under the bunk and all scratched and cut about where theyd tried to force the lock but i understood that it had been opened with a key thats so they tried to force it but couldnt and in the end they must have got it unlocked somehow or other curious said poirot his eyes beginning to flicker with the green light i knew so well very curious they waste much much time trying to prise it open and thensapristi they find that they have the key all the timefor each of hubbss locks are unique thats just why they couldnt have had the key it never left me day or night you are sure of that i can swear to it and besides if they had had the key or a duplicate why should they waste time trying to force an obviously unforceable lock ah there is exactly the question we are asking ourselves i venture to prophesy that the solution if we ever find it will hinge on that curious fact i beg of you not to assault me if i ask you one more question are you perfectly certain you did not leave the trunk unlocked philip ridgeway merely looked at him and poirot gesticulated apologetically ah but these things can happen i assure you very well the bonds were stolen from the trunk what did the thief do with them how did he manage to get ashore with them ah cried ridgeway thats just it how word was passed to the customs authorities and every soul that left the ship was gone over with a toothcomb and the bonds i gather made a bulky package certainly they did they could hardly have been hidden on boardand anyway we know they werent because they were offered for sale within half an hour of the olympias arrival long before i got the cables going and the numbers sent out one broker swears he bought some of them even before the olympia got in but you cant send bonds by wireless not by wireless but did any tug come alongside only the official ones and that was after the alarm was given when every one was on the lookout i was watching out myself for their being passed over to some one that way my god monsieur poirot this thing will drive me mad people are beginning to say i stole them myself but you also were searched on landing werent you asked poirot gently yes the young man stared at him in a puzzled manner you do not catch my meaning i see said poirot smiling enigmatically now i should like to make a few inquiries at the bank ridgeway produced a card and scribbled a few words on it send this in and my uncle will see you at once poirot thanked him bade farewell to miss farquhar and together we started out for threadneedle street and the head office of the london and scottish bank on production of ridgeways card we were led through the labyrinth of counters and desks skirting payingin clerks and payingout clerks and up to a small office on the first floor where the joint general managers received us they were two grave gentlemen who had grown grey in the service of the bank mr vavasour had a short white beard mr shaw was clean shaven i understand you are strictly a private inquiry agent said mr vavasour quite so quite so we have of course placed ourselves in the hands of scotland yard inspector mcneil has charge of the case a very able officer i believe i am sure of it said poirot politely you will permit a few questions on your nephews behalf about this lock who ordered it from hubbss i ordered it myself said mr shaw i would not trust to any clerk in the matter as to the keys mr ridgeway had one and the other two are held by my colleague and myself and no clerk has had access to them mr shaw turned inquiringly to mr vavasour i think i am correct in saying that they have remained in the safe where we placed them on the rd said mr vavasour my colleague was unfortunately taken ill a fortnight agoin fact on the very day that philip left us he has only just recovered severe bronchitis is no joke to a man of my age said mr shaw ruefully but i am afraid mr vavasour has suffered from the hard work entailed by my absence especially with this unexpected worry coming on top of everything poirot asked a few more questions i judged that he was endeavouring to gauge the exact amount of intimacy between uncle and nephew mr vavasours answers were brief and punctilious his nephew was a trusted official of the bank and had no debts or money difficulties that he knew of he had been entrusted with similar missions in the past finally we were politely bowed out i am disappointed said poirot as we emerged into the street you hoped to discover more they are such stodgy old men it is not their stodginess which disappoints me mon ami i do not expect to find in a bank manager a keen financier with an eagle glance as your favourite works of fiction put it no i am disappointed in the caseit is too easy easy yes do you not find it almost childishly simple you know who stole the bonds i do but thenwe mustwhy do not confuse and fluster yourself hastings we are not going to do anything at present but why what are you waiting for for the olympia she is due on her return trip from new york on tuesday but if you know who stole the bonds why wait he may escape to a south sea island where there is no extradition no mon ami he would find life very uncongenial there as to why i waiteh bien to the intelligence of hercule poirot the case is perfectly clear but for the benefit of others not so greatly gifted by the good godthe inspector mcneil for instanceit would be as well to make a few inquiries to establish the facts one must have consideration for those less gifted than oneself good lord poirot do you know id give a considerable sum of money to see you make a thorough ass of yourselfjust for once youre so confoundedly conceited do not enrage yourself hastings in verity i observe that there are times when you almost detest me alas i suffer the penalties of greatness the little man puffed out his chest and sighed so comically that i was forced to laugh tuesday saw us speeding to liverpool in a firstclass carriage of the l  nwr poirot had obstinately refused to enlighten me as to his suspicionsor certainties he contented himself with expressing surprise that i too was not equally au fait with the situation i disdained to argue and entrenched my curiosity behind a rampart of pretended indifference once arrived at the quay alongside which lay the big transatlantic liner poirot became brisk and alert our proceedings consisted in interviewing four successive stewards and inquiring after a friend of poirots who had crossed to new york on the rd an elderly gentleman wearing glasses a great invalid hardly moved out of his cabin the description appeared to tally with one mr ventnor who had occupied the cabin c  which was next to that of philip ridgeway although unable to see how poirot had deduced mr ventnors existence and personal appearance i was keenly excited tell me i cried was this gentleman one of the first to land when you got to new york the steward shook his head no indeed sir he was one of the last off the boat i retired crestfallen and observed poirot grinning at me he thanked the steward a note changed hands and we took our departure its all very well i remarked heatedly but that last answer must have damped your precious theory grin as you please as usual you see nothing hastings that last answer is on the contrary the copingstone of my theory i flung up my hands in despair i give it up                      when we were in the train speeding towards london poirot wrote busily for a few minutes sealing up the result in an envelope this is for the good inspector mcneil we will leave it at scotland yard in passing and then to the rendezvous restaurant where i have asked miss esme farquhar to do us the honour of dining with us what about ridgeway what about him asked poirot with a twinkle why you surely dont thinkyou cant the habit of incoherence is growing upon you hastings as a matter of fact i did think if ridgeway had been the thiefwhich was perfectly possiblethe case would have been charming a piece of neat methodical work but not so charming for miss farquhar possibly you are right therefore all is for the best now hastings let us review the case i can see that you are dying to do so the sealed package is removed from the trunk and vanishes as miss farquhar puts it into thin air we will dismiss the thin air theory which is not practicable at the present stage of science and consider what is likely to have become of it every one asserts the incredibility of its being smuggled ashore yes but we know you may know hastings i do not i take the view that since it seemed incredible it was incredible two possibilities remain it was hidden on boardalso rather difficultor it was thrown overboard with a cork on it do you mean without a cork i stared but if the bonds were thrown overboard they couldnt have been sold in new york i admire your logical mind hastings the bonds were sold in new york therefore they were not thrown overboard you see where that leads us where we were when we started jamais de la vie if the package was thrown overboard and the bonds were sold in new york the package could not have contained the bonds is there any evidence that the package did contain the bonds remember mr ridgeway never opened it from the time it was placed in his hands in london yes but then poirot waved an impatient hand permit me to continue the last moment that the bonds are seen as bonds is in the office of the london and scottish bank on the morning of the rd they reappear in new york half an hour after the olympia gets in and according to one man whom nobody listens to actually before she gets in supposing then that they have never been on the olympia at all is there any other way they could get to new york yes the gigantic leaves southampton on the same day as the olympia and she holds the record for the atlantic mailed by the gigantic the bonds would be in new york the day before the olympia arrived all is clear the case begins to explain itself the sealed packet is only a dummy and the moment of its substitution must be in the office in the bank it would be an easy matter for any of the three men present to have prepared a duplicate package which could be substituted for the genuine one trs bien the bonds are mailed to a confederate in new york with instructions to sell as soon as the olympia is in but some one must travel on the olympia to engineer the supposed moment of the robbery but why because if ridgeway merely opens the packet and finds it a dummy suspicion flies at once to london no the man on board in the cabin next door does his work pretends to force the lock in an obvious manner so as to draw immediate attention to the theft really unlocks the trunk with a duplicate key throws the package overboard and waits until the last to leave the boat naturally he wears glasses to conceal his eyes and is an invalid since he does not want to run the risk of meeting ridgeway he steps ashore in new york and returns by the first boat available but whowhich was he the man who had a duplicate key the man who ordered the lock the man who has not been severely ill with bronchitis at his home in the countryenfin that stodgy old man mr shaw there are criminals in high places sometimes my friend ah here we are mademoiselle i have succeeded you permit and beaming poirot kissed the astonished girl lightly on either cheek   vi   the adventure of the egyptian tomb i have always considered that one of the most thrilling and dramatic of the many adventures i have shared with poirot was that of our investigation into the strange series of deaths which followed upon the discovery and opening of the tomb of king menherra hard upon the discovery of the tomb of tutankhamen by lord carnarvon sir john willard and mr bleibner of new york pursuing their excavations not far from cairo in the vicinity of the pyramids of gizeh came unexpectedly on a series of funeral chambers the greatest interest was aroused by their discovery the tomb appeared to be that of king menherra one of those shadowy kings of the eighth dynasty when the old kingdom was falling to decay little was known about this period and the discoveries were fully reported in the newspapers an event soon occurred which took a profound hold on the public mind sir john willard died quite suddenly of heart failure the more sensational newspapers immediately took the opportunity of reviving all the old superstitious stories connected with the ill luck of certain egyptian treasures the unlucky mummy at the british museum that hoary old chestnut was dragged out with fresh zest was quietly denied by the museum but nevertheless enjoyed all its usual vogue a fortnight later mr bleibner died of acute blood poisoning and a few days afterwards a nephew of his shot himself in new york the curse of menherra was the talk of the day and the magic power of dead and gone egypt was exalted to a fetish point it was then that poirot received a brief note from lady willard widow of the dead archaeologist asking him to go and see her at her house in kensington square i accompanied him lady willard was a tall thin woman dressed in deep mourning her haggard face bore eloquent testimony to her recent grief it is kind of you to have come so promptly monsieur poirot i am at your service lady willard you wished to consult me you are i am aware a detective but it is not only as a detective that i wish to consult you you are a man of original views i know you have imagination experience of the world tell me monsieur poirot what are your views on the supernatural poirot hesitated for a moment before he replied he seemed to be considering finally he said let us not misunderstand each other lady willard it is not a general question that you are asking me there it has a personal application has it not you are referring obliquely to the death of your late husband that is so she admitted you want me to investigate the circumstances of his death i want you to ascertain for me exactly how much is newspaper chatter and how much may be said to be founded on fact three deaths monsieur poiroteach one explicable taken by itself but taken together surely an almost unbelievable coincidence and all within a month of the opening of the tomb it may be mere superstition it may be some potent curse from the past that operates in ways undreamed of by modern science the fact remainsthree deaths and i am afraid monsieur poirot horribly afraid it may not yet be the end for whom do you fear for my son when the news of my husbands death came i was ill my son who has just come down from oxford went out there he brought thethe body home but now he has gone out again in spite of my prayers and entreaties he is so fascinated by the work that he intends to take his fathers place and carry on the system of excavations you may think me a foolish credulous woman but monsieur poirot i am afraid supposing that the spirit of the dead king is not yet appeased perhaps to you i seem to be talking nonsense no indeed lady willard said poirot quickly i too believe in the force of superstition one of the greatest forces the world has ever known i looked at him in surprise i should never have credited poirot with being superstitious but the little man was obviously in earnest what you really demand is that i shall protect your son i will do my utmost to keep him from harm yes in the ordinary way but against an occult influence in volumes of the middle ages lady willard you will find many ways of counteracting black magic perhaps they knew more than we moderns with all our boasted science now let us come to facts that i may have guidance your husband had always been a devoted egyptologist hadnt he yes from his youth upwards he was one of the greatest living authorities upon the subject but mr bleibner i understand was more or less of an amateur oh quite he was a very wealthy man who dabbled freely in any subject that happened to take his fancy my husband managed to interest him in egyptology and it was his money that was so useful in financing the expedition and the nephew what do you know of his tastes was he with the party at all i do not think so in fact i never knew of his existence till i read of his death in the paper i do not think he and mr bleibner can have been at all intimate he never spoke of having any relations who are the other members of the party well there is dr tosswill a minor official connected with the british museum mr schneider of the metropolitan museum in new york a young american secretary dr ames who accompanies the expedition in his professional capacity and hassan my husbands devoted native servant do you remember the name of the american secretary harper i think but i cannot be sure he had not been with mr bleibner very long i know he was a very pleasant young fellow thank you lady willard if there is anything else for the moment nothing leave it now in my hands and be assured that i will do all that is humanly possible to protect your son they were not exactly reassuring words and i observed lady willard wince as he uttered them yet at the same time the fact that he had not poohpoohed her fears seemed in itself to be a relief to her for my part i had never before suspected that poirot had so deep a vein of superstition in his nature i tackled him on the subject as we went homewards his manner was grave and earnest but yes hastings i believe in these things you must not underrate the force of superstition what are we going to do about it toujours pratique the good hastings eh bien to begin with we are going to cable to new york for fuller details of young mr bleibners death he duly sent off his cable the reply was full and precise young rupert bleibner had been in low water for several years he had been a beachcomber and a remittance man in several south sea islands but had returned to new york two years ago where he had rapidly sunk lower and lower the most significant thing to my mind was that he had recently managed to borrow enough money to take him to egypt ive a good friend there i can borrow from he had declared here however his plans had gone awry he had returned to new york cursing his skinflint of an uncle who cared more for the bones of dead and gone kings than his own flesh and blood it was during his sojourn in egypt that the death of sir john willard occurred rupert had plunged once more into his life of dissipation in new york and then without warning he had committed suicide leaving behind him a letter which contained some curious phrases it seemed written in a sudden fit of remorse he referred to himself as a leper and an outcast and the letter ended by declaring that such as he were better dead a shadowy theory leapt into my brain i had never really believed in the vengeance of a long dead egyptian king i saw here a more modern crime supposing this young man had decided to do away with his unclepreferably by poison by mistake sir john willard receives the fatal dose the young man returns to new york haunted by his crime the news of his uncles death reaches him he realizes how unnecessary his crime has been and stricken with remorse takes his own life i outlined my solution to poirot he was interested it is ingenious what you have thought of theredecidedly it is ingenious it may even be true but you leave out of count the fatal influence of the tomb i shrugged my shoulders you still think that has something to do with it so much so mon ami that we start for egypt tomorrow what i cried astonished i have said it an expression of conscious heroism spread over poirots face then he groaned but oh he lamented the sea the hateful sea                      it was a week later beneath our feet was the golden sand of the desert the hot sun poured down overhead poirot the picture of misery wilted by my side the little man was not a good traveller our four days voyage from marseilles had been one long agony to him he had landed at alexandria the wraith of his former self even his usual neatness had deserted him we had arrived in cairo and had driven out at once to the mena house hotel right in the shadow of the pyramids the charm of egypt had laid hold of me not so poirot dressed precisely the same as in london he carried a small clothesbrush in his pocket and waged an unceasing war on the dust which accumulated on his dark apparel and my boots he wailed regard them hastings my boots of the neat patent leather usually so smart and shining see the sand is inside them which is painful and outside them which outrages the eyesight also the heat it causes my moustaches to become limpbut limp look at the sphinx i urged even i can feel the mystery and the charm it exhales poirot looked at it discontentedly it has not the air happy he declared how could it halfburied in sand in that untidy fashion ah this cursed sand come now theres a lot of sand in belgium i reminded him mindful of a holiday spent at knockesurmer in the midst of les dunes impeccables as the guidebook had phrased it not in brussels declared poirot he gazed at the pyramids thoughtfully it is true that they at least are of a shape solid and geometrical but their surface is of an unevenness most unpleasing and the palmtrees i like them not not even do they plant them in rows i cut short his lamentations by suggesting that we should start for the camp we were to ride there on camels and the beasts were patiently kneeling waiting for us to mount in charge of several picturesque boys headed by a voluble dragoman i pass over the spectacle of poirot on a camel he started by groans and lamentations and ended by shrieks gesticulations and invocations to the virgin mary and every saint in the calendar in the end he descended ignominiously and finished the journey on a diminutive donkey i must admit that a trotting camel is no joke for the amateur i was stiff for several days at last we neared the scene of the excavations a sunburnt man with a grey beard in white clothes and wearing a helmet came to meet us monsieur poirot and captain hastings we received your cable im sorry that there was no one to meet you in cairo an unforeseen event occurred which completely disorganized our plans poirot paled his hand which had stolen to his clothesbrush stayed its course not another death he breathed yes sir guy willard i cried no captain hastings my american colleague mr schneider and the cause demanded poirot tetanus i blanched all around me i seemed to feel an atmosphere of evil subtle and menacing a horrible thought flashed across me supposing i were the next mon dieu said poirot in a very low voice i do not understand this it is horrible tell me monsieur there is no doubt that it was tetanus i believe not but dr ames will tell you more than i can do ah of course you are not the doctor my name is tosswill this then was the british expert described by lady willard as being a minor official at the british museum there was something at once grave and steadfast about him that took my fancy if you will come with me continued dr tosswill i will take you to sir guy willard he was most anxious to be informed as soon as you should arrive we were taken across the camp to a large tent dr tosswill lifted up the flap and we entered three men were sitting inside monsieur poirot and captain hastings have arrived sir guy said tosswill the youngest of the three men jumped up and came forward to greet us there was a certain impulsiveness in his manner which reminded me of his mother he was not nearly so sunburnt as the others and that fact coupled with a certain haggardness round the eyes made him look older than his twentytwo years he was clearly endeavouring to bear up under a severe mental strain he introduced his two companions dr ames a capable looking man of thirty odd with a touch of greying hair at the temples and mr harper the secretary a pleasant lean young man wearing the national insignia of hornrimmed spectacles after a few minutes desultory conversation the latter went out and dr tosswill followed him we were left alone with sir guy and dr ames please ask any questions you want to ask monsieur poirot said willard we are utterly dumbfounded at this strange series of disasters but it isntit cant be anything but coincidence there was a nervousness about his manner which rather belied the words i saw that poirot was studying him keenly your heart is really in this work sir guy rather no matter what happens or what comes of it the work is going on make up your mind to that poirot wheeled round on the other what have you to say to that monsieur le docteur well drawled the doctor im not for quitting myself poirot made one of those expressive grimaces of his then videmment we must find out just how we stand when did mr schneiders death take place three days ago you are sure it was tetanus dead sure it couldnt have been a case of strychnine poisoning for instance no monsieur poirot i see what youre getting at but it was a clear case of tetanus did you not inject antiserum certainly we did said the doctor dryly every conceivable thing that could be done was tried had you the antiserum with you no we procured it from cairo have there been any other cases of tetanus in the camp no not one are you certain that the death of mr bleibner was not due to tetanus absolutely plumb certain he had a scratch upon his thumb which became poisoned and septicmia set in it sounds pretty much the same to a layman i dare say but the two things are entirely different then we have four deathsall totally dissimilar one heart failure one blood poisoning one suicide and one tetanus exactly monsieur poirot are you certain that there is nothing which might link the four together i dont quite understand you i will put it plainly was any act committed by those four men which might seem to denote disrespect to the spirit of menherra the doctor gazed at poirot in astonishment youre talking through your hat monsieur poirot surely youve not been guyed into believing all that fool talk absolute nonsense muttered willard angrily poirot remained placidly immovable blinking a little out of his green cats eyes so you do not believe it monsieur le docteur no sir i do not declared the doctor emphatically i am a scientific man and i believe only what science teaches was there no science then in ancient egypt asked poirot softly he did not wait for a reply and indeed dr ames seemed rather at a loss for the moment no no do not answer me but tell me this what do the native workmen think i guess said dr ames that where white folk lose their heads natives arent going to be far behind ill admit that theyre getting what you might call scaredbut theyve no cause to be i wonder said poirot noncommittally sir guy leant forward surely he cried incredulously you cannot believe inoh but the things absurd you can know nothing of ancient egypt if you think that for answer poirot produced a little book from his pocketan ancient tattered volume as he held it out i saw its title the magic of the egyptians and chaldeans then wheeling round he strode out of the tent the doctor stared at me what is his little idea the phrase so familiar on poirots lips made me smile as it came from another i dont know exactly i confessed hes got some plan of exorcizing the evil spirits i believe i went in search of poirot and found him talking to the leanfaced young man who had been the late mr bleibners secretary no mr harper was saying ive only been six months with the expedition yes i knew mr bleibners affairs pretty well can you recount to me anything concerning his nephew he turned up here one day not a badlooking fellow id never met him before but some of the others hadames i think and schneider the old man wasnt at all pleased to see him they were at it in no time hammer and tongs not a cent the old man shouted not one cent now or when im dead i intend to leave my money to the furtherance of my lifes work ive been talking it over with mr schneider today and a bit more of the same young bleibner lit out for cairo right away was he in perfectly good health at the time the old man no the young one i believe he did mention there was something wrong with him but it couldnt have been anything serious or i should have remembered one thing more has mr bleibner left a will so far as we know he has not are you remaining with the expedition mr harper no sir i am not im for new york as soon as i can square up things here you may laugh if you like but im not going to be this blasted old menherras next victim hell get me if i stop here the young man wiped the perspiration from his brow poirot turned away over his shoulder he said with a peculiar smile remember he got one of his victims in new york oh hell said mr harper forcibly that young man is nervous said poirot thoughtfully he is on the edge but absolutely on the edge i glanced at poirot curiously but his enigmatical smile told me nothing in company with sir guy willard and dr tosswill we were taken round the excavations the principal finds had been removed to cairo but some of the tomb furniture was extremely interesting the enthusiasm of the young baronet was obvious but i fancied that i detected a shade of nervousness in his manner as though he could not quite escape from the feeling of menace in the air as we entered the tent which had been assigned to us for a wash before joining the evening meal a tall dark figure in white robes stood aside to let us pass with a graceful gesture and a murmured greeting in arabic poirot stopped you are hassan the late sir john willards servant i served my lord sir john now i serve his son he took a step nearer to us and lowered his voice you are a wise one they say learned in dealing with evil spirits let the young master depart from here there is evil in the air around us and with an abrupt gesture not waiting for a reply he strode away evil in the air muttered poirot yes i feel it our meal was hardly a cheerful one the floor was left to dr tosswill who discoursed at length upon egyptian antiquities just as we were preparing to retire to rest sir guy caught poirot by the arm and pointed a shadowy figure was moving amidst the tents it was no human one i recognized distinctly the dogheaded figure i had seen carved on the walls of the tomb my blood literally froze at the sight mon dieu murmured poirot crossing himself vigorously anubis the jackalheaded the god of departing souls some one is hoaxing us cried dr tosswill rising indignantly to his feet it went into your tent harper muttered sir guy his face dreadfully pale no said poirot shaking his head into that of the dr ames the doctor stared at him incredulously then repeating dr tosswills words he cried some one is hoaxing us come well soon catch the fellow he dashed energetically in pursuit of the shadowy apparition i followed him but search as we would we could find no trace of any living soul having passed that way we returned somewhat disturbed in mind to find poirot taking energetic measures in his own way to ensure his personal safety he was busily surrounding our tent with various diagrams and inscriptions which he was drawing in the sand i recognized the fivepointed star or pentagon many times repeated as was his wont poirot was at the same time delivering an impromptu lecture on witchcraft and magic in general white magic as opposed to black with various references to the ka and the book of the dead thrown in it appeared to excite the liveliest contempt in dr tosswill who drew me aside literally snorting with rage balderdash sir he exclaimed angrily pure balderdash the mans an impostor he doesnt know the difference between the superstitions of the middle ages and the beliefs of ancient egypt never have i heard such a hotchpotch of ignorance and credulity i calmed the excited expert and joined poirot in the tent my little friend was beaming cheerfully we can now sleep in peace he declared happily and i can do with some sleep my head it aches abominably ah for a good tisane as though in answer to prayer the flap of the tent was lifted and hassan appeared bearing a steaming cup which he offered to poirot it proved to be camomile tea a beverage of which he is inordinately fond having thanked hassan and refused his offer of another cup for myself we were left alone once more i stood at the door of the tent some time after undressing looking out over the desert a wonderful place i said aloud and a wonderful work i can feel the fascination this desert life this probing into the heart of a vanished civilization surely poirot you too must feel the charm i got no answer and i turned a little annoyed my annoyance was quickly changed to concern poirot was lying back across the rude couch his face horribly convulsed beside him was the empty cup i rushed to his side then dashed out and across the camp to dr amess tent dr ames i cried come at once whats the matter said the doctor appearing in pyjamas my friend hes ill dying the camomile tea dont let hassan leave the camp like a flash the doctor ran to our tent poirot was lying as i left him extraordinary cried ames looks like a seizureorwhat did you say about something he drank he picked up the empty cup only i did not drink it said a placid voice we turned in amazement poirot was sitting up on the bed he was smiling no he said gently i did not drink it while my good friend hastings was apostrophizing the night i took the opportunity of pouring it not down my throat but into a little bottle that little bottle will go to the analytical chemist noas the doctor made a sudden movementas a sensible man you will understand that violence will be of no avail during hastings brief absence to fetch you i have had time to put the bottle in safe keeping ah quick hastings hold him i misunderstood poirots anxiety eager to save my friend i flung myself in front of him but the doctors swift movement had another meaning his hand went to his mouth a smell of bitter almonds filled the air and he swayed forward and fell another victim said poirot gravely but the last perhaps it is the best way he has three deaths on his head dr ames i cried stupefied but i thought you believed in some occult influence you misunderstood me hastings what i meant was that i believe in the terrific force of superstition once get it firmly established that a series of deaths are supernatural and you might almost stab a man in broad daylight and it would still be put down to the curse so strongly is the instinct of the supernatural implanted in the human race i suspected from the first that a man was taking advantage of that instinct the idea came to him i imagine with the death of sir john willard a fury of superstition arose at once as far as i could see nobody could derive any particular profit from sir johns death mr bleibner was a different case he was a man of great wealth the information i received from new york contained several suggestive points to begin with young bleibner was reported to have said he had a good friend in egypt from whom he could borrow it was tacitly understood that he meant his uncle but it seemed to me that in that case he would have said so outright the words suggest some boon companion of his own another thing he scraped up enough money to take him to egypt his uncle refused outright to advance him a penny yet he was able to pay the return passage to new york some one must have lent him the money all that was very thin i objected but there was more hastings there occur often enough words spoken metaphorically which are taken literally the opposite can happen too in this case words which were meant literally were taken metaphorically young bleibner wrote plainly enough i am a leper but nobody realized that he shot himself because he believed that he had contracted the dread disease of leprosy what i ejaculated it was the clever invention of a diabolical mind young bleibner was suffering from some minor skin trouble he had lived in the south sea islands where the disease is common enough ames was a former friend of his and a wellknown medical man he would never dream of doubting his word when i arrived here my suspicions were divided between harper and dr ames but i soon realized that only the doctor could have perpetrated and concealed the crimes and i learnt from harper that he was previously acquainted with young bleibner doubtless the latter at some time or another had made a will or had insured his life in favour of the doctor the latter saw his chance of acquiring wealth it was easy for him to inoculate mr bleibner with the deadly germs then the nephew overcome with despair at the dread news his friend had conveyed to him shot himself mr bleibner whatever his intentions had made no will his fortune would pass to his nephew and from him to the doctor and mr schneider we cannot be sure he knew young bleibner too remember and may have suspected something or again the doctor may have thought that a further death motiveless and purposeless would strengthen the coils of superstition furthermore i will tell you an interesting psychological fact hastings a murderer has always a strong desire to repeat his successful crime the performance of it grows upon him hence my fears for young willard the figure of anubis you saw tonight was hassan dressed up by my orders i wanted to see if i could frighten the doctor but it would take more than the supernatural to frighten him i could see that he was not entirely taken in by my pretences of belief in the occult the little comedy i played for him did not deceive him i suspected that he would endeavour to make me the next victim ah but in spite of la mer maudite the heat abominable and the annoyances of the sand the little grey cells still functioned poirot proved to be perfectly right in his premises young bleibner some years ago in a fit of drunken merriment had made a jocular will leaving my cigarette case you admire so much and everything else of which i die possessed which will be principally debts to my good friend robert ames who once saved my life from drowning the case was hushed up as far as possible and to this day people talk of the remarkable series of deaths in connection with the tomb of menherra as a triumphal proof of the vengeance of a bygone king upon the desecrators of his tomba belief which as poirot pointed out to me is contrary to all egyptian belief and thought   vii   the jewel robbery at the grand metropolitan poirot i said a change of air would do you good you think so mon ami i am sure of it eheh said my friend smiling it is all arranged then you will come where do you propose to take me brighton as a matter of fact a friend of mine in the city put me on to a very good thing andwell i have money to burn as the saying goes i think a weekend at the grand metropolitan would do us all the good in the world thank you i accept most gratefully you have the good heart to think of an old man and the good heart it is in the end worth all the little grey cells yes yes i who speak to you am in danger of forgetting that sometimes i did not quite relish the implication i fancy that poirot is sometimes a little inclined to underestimate my mental capacities but his pleasure was so evident that i put my slight annoyance aside then thats all right i said hastily saturday evening saw us dining at the grand metropolitan in the midst of a gay throng all the world and his wife seemed to be at brighton the dresses were marvellous and the jewelsworn sometimes with more love of display than good tastewere something magnificent hein it is a sight this murmured poirot this is the home of the profiteer is it not so hastings supposed to be i replied but well hope they arent all tarred with the profiteering brush poirot gazed round him placidly the sight of so many jewels makes me wish i had turned my brains to crime instead of to its detection what a magnificent opportunity for some thief of distinction regard hastings that stout woman by the pillar she is as you would say plastered with gems i followed his eyes why i exclaimed its mrs opalsen you know her slightly her husband is a rich stockbroker who made a fortune in the recent oil boom after dinner we ran across the opalsens in the lounge and i introduced poirot to them we chatted for a few minutes and ended by having our coffee together poirot said a few words in praise of some of the costlier gems displayed on the ladys ample bosom and she brightened up at once its a perfect hobby of mine mr poirot i just love jewellery ed knows my weakness and every time things go well he brings me something new you are interested in precious stones i have had a good deal to do with them one time and another madame my profession has brought me into contact with some of the most famous jewels in the world he went on to narrate with discreet pseudonyms the story of the historic jewels of a reigning house and mrs opalsen listened with bated breath there now she exclaimed as he ended if it isnt just like a play you know ive got some pearls of my own that have a history attached to them i believe its supposed to be one of the finest necklaces in the worldthe pearls are so beautifully matched and so perfect in colour i declare i really must run up and get it oh madame protested poirot you are too amiable pray do not derange yourself oh but id like to show it to you the buxom dame waddled across to the lift briskly enough her husband who had been talking to me looked at poirot inquiringly madame your wife is so amiable as to insist on showing me her pearl necklace explained the latter oh the pearls opalsen smiled in a satisfied fashion well they are worth seeing cost a pretty penny too still the moneys there all right i could get what i paid for them any dayperhaps more may have to too if things go on as they are now moneys confoundedly tight in the city all this infernal epd he rambled on launching into technicalities where i could not follow him he was interrupted by a small pageboy who approached and murmured something in his ear ehwhat ill come at once not taken ill is she excuse me gentlemen he left us abruptly poirot leaned back and lit one of his tiny russian cigarettes then carefully and meticulously he arranged the empty coffeecups in a neat row and beamed happily on the result the minutes passed the opalsens did not return curious i remarked at length i wonder when they will come back poirot watched the ascending spirals of smoke and then said thoughtfully they will not come back why because my friend something has happened what sort of thing how do you know i asked curiously poirot smiled a few moments ago the manager came hurriedly out of his office and ran upstairs he was much agitated the liftboy is deep in talk with one of the pages the liftbell has rung three times but he heeds it not thirdly even the waiters are distrait and to make a waiter distrait poirot shook his head with an air of finality the affair must indeed be of the first magnitude ah it is as i thought here come the police two men had just entered the hotelone in uniform the other in plain clothes they spoke to a page and were immediately ushered upstairs a few minutes later the same boy descended and came up to where we were sitting mr opalsens compliments and would you step upstairs poirot sprang nimbly to his feet one would have said that he awaited the summons i followed with no less alacrity the opalsens apartments were situated on the first floor after knocking on the door the pageboy retired and we answered the summons come in a strange scene met our eyes the room was mrs opalsens bedroom and in the centre of it lying back in an armchair was the lady herself weeping violently she presented an extraordinary spectacle with the tears making great furrows in the powder with which her complexion was liberally coated mr opalsen was striding up and down angrily the two police officials stood in the middle of the room one with a notebook in hand an hotel chambermaid looking frightened to death stood by the fireplace and on the other side of the room a frenchwoman obviously mrs opalsens maid was weeping and wringing her hands with an intensity of grief that rivalled that of her mistress into this pandemonium stepped poirot neat and smiling immediately with an energy surprising in one of her bulk mrs opalsen sprang from her chair towards him there now ed may say what he likes but i believe in luck i do it was fated i should meet you the way i did this evening and ive a feeling that if you cant get my pearls back for me nobody can calm yourself i pray of you madame poirot patted her hand soothingly reassure yourself all will be well hercule poirot will aid you mr opalsen turned to the police inspector there will be no objection to myercalling in this gentleman i suppose none at all sir replied the man civilly but with complete indifference perhaps now your ladys feeling better shell just let us have the facts mrs opalsen looked helplessly at poirot he led her back to her chair seat yourself madame and recount to us the whole history without agitating yourself thus abjured mrs opalsen dried her eyes gingerly and began i came upstairs after dinner to fetch my pearls for mr poirot here to see the chambermaid and clestine were both in the room as usual excuse me madame but what do you mean by as usual mr opalsen explained i make it a rule that no one is to come into this room unless clestine the maid is there also the chambermaid does the room in the morning while clestine is present and comes in after dinner to turn down the beds under the same conditions otherwise she never enters the room well as i was saying continued mrs opalsen i came up i went to the drawer hereshe indicated the bottom righthand drawer of the kneehole dressingtabletook out my jewelcase and unlocked it it seemed quite as usualbut the pearls were not there the inspector had been busy with his notebook when had you last seen them he asked they were there when i went down to dinner you are sure quite sure i was uncertain whether to wear them or not but in the end i decided on the emeralds and put them back in the jewelcase who locked up the jewelcase i did i wear the key on a chain round my neck she held it up as she spoke the inspector examined it and shrugged his shoulders the thief must have had a duplicate key no difficult matter the lock is quite a simple one what did you do after youd locked the jewelcase i put it back in the bottom drawer where i always keep it you didnt lock the drawer no i never do my maid remains in the room till i come up so theres no need the inspectors face grew graver am i to understand that the jewels were there when you went down to dinner and that since then the maid has not left the room suddenly as though the horror of her own situation for the first time burst upon her clestine uttered a piercing shriek and flinging herself upon poirot poured out a torrent of incoherent french the suggestion was infamous that she should be suspected of robbing madame the police were well known to be of a stupidity incredible but monsieur who was a frenchman a belgian interjected poirot but clestine paid no attention to the correction monsieur would not stand by and see her falsely accused while that infamous chambermaid was allowed to go scotfree she had never liked hera bold redfaced thinga born thief she had said from the first that she was not honest and had kept a sharp watch over her too when she was doing madames room let those idiots of policemen search her and if they did not find madames pearls on her it would be very surprising although this harangue was uttered in rapid and virulent french clestine had interlarded it with a wealth of gesture and the chambermaid realized at least a part of her meaning she reddened angrily if that foreign womans saying i took the pearls its a lie she declared heatedly i never so much as saw them search her screamed the other you will find it is as i say youre a liardo you hear said the chambermaid advancing upon her stole em yourself and want to put it on me why i was only in the room about three minutes before the lady come up and then you were sitting here the whole time as you always do like a cat watching a mouse the inspector looked across inquiringly at clestine is that true didnt you leave the room at all i did not actually leave her alone admitted clestine reluctantly but i went into my own room through the door here twiceonce to fetch a reel of cotton and once for my scissors she must have done it then you wasnt gone a minute retorted the chambermaid angrily just popped out and in again id be glad if the police would search me ive nothing to be afraid of at this moment there was a tap at the door the inspector went to it his face brightened when he saw who it was ah he said thats rather fortunate i sent for one of our female searchers and shes just arrived perhaps if you wouldnt mind going into the room next door he looked at the chambermaid who stepped across the threshold with a toss of her head the searcher following her closely the french girl had sunk sobbing into a chair poirot was looking round the room the main features of which i have made clear by a sketch a sketch of the bedroom adjoining maids room and corridor where does that door lead he inquired nodding his head towards the one by the window into the next apartment i believe said the inspector its bolted anyway on this side poirot walked across to it tried it then drew back the bolt and tried it again and on the other side as well he remarked well that seems to rule out that he walked over to the windows examining each of them in turn and againnothing not even a balcony outside even if there were said the inspector impatiently i dont see how that would help us if the maid never left the room videmment said poirot not disconcerted as mademoiselle is positive she did not leave the room he was interrupted by the reappearance of the chambermaid and the police searcher nothing said the latter laconically i should hope not indeed said the chambermaid virtuously and that french hussy ought to be ashamed of herself taking away an honest girls character there there my girl thats all right said the inspector opening the door nobody suspects you you go along and get on with your work the chambermaid went unwillingly going to search her she demanded pointing at clestine yes yes he shut the door on her and turned the key clestine accompanied the searcher into the small room in her turn a few minutes later she also returned nothing had been found on her the inspectors face grew graver im afraid ill have to ask you to come along with me all the same miss he turned to mrs opalsen im sorry madam but all the evidence points that way if shes not got them on her theyre hidden somewhere about the room clestine uttered a piercing shriek and clung to poirots arm the latter bent and whispered something in the girls ear she looked up at him doubtfully si si mon enfanti assure you it is better not to resist then he turned to the inspector you permit monsieur a little experimentpurely for my own satisfaction depends on what it is replied the police officer noncommittally poirot addressed clestine once more you have told us that you went into your room to fetch a reel of cotton whereabouts was it on the top of the chest of drawers monsieur and the scissors they also would it be troubling you too much mademoiselle to ask you to repeat those two actions you were sitting here with your work you say clestine sat down and then at a sign from poirot rose passed into the adjoining room took up an object from the chest of drawers and returned poirot divided his attention between her movements and a large turnip of a watch which he held in the palm of his hand again if you please mademoiselle at the conclusion of the second performance he made a note in his pocketbook and returned the watch to his pocket thank you mademoiselle and you monsieurhe bowed to the inspectorfor your courtesy the inspector seemed somewhat entertained by this excessive politeness clestine departed in a flood of tears accompanied by the woman and the plainclothes official then with a brief apology to mrs opalsen the inspector set to work to ransack the room he pulled out drawers opened cupboards completely unmade the bed and tapped the floor mr opalsen looked on sceptically you really think you will find them yes sir it stands to reason she hadnt time to take them out of the room the ladys discovering the robbery so soon upset her plans no theyre here right enough one of the two must have hidden themand its very unlikely for the chambermaid to have done so more than unlikelyimpossible said poirot quietly eh the inspector stared poirot smiled modestly i will demonstrate hastings my good friend take my watch in your handwith care it is a family heirloom just now i timed mademoiselles movementsher first absence from the room was of twelve seconds her second of fifteen now observe my actions madame will have the kindness to give me the key of the jewelcase i thank you my friend hastings will have the kindness to say go go i said with almost incredible swiftness poirot wrenched open the drawer of the dressingtable extracted the jewelcase fitted the key in the lock opened the case selected a piece of jewellery shut and locked the case and returned it to the drawer which he pushed to again his movements were like lightning well mon ami he demanded of me breathlessly fortysix seconds i replied you see he looked round there would not have been time for the chambermaid even to take the necklace out far less hide it then that settles it on the maid said the inspector with satisfaction and returned to his search he passed into the maids bedroom next door poirot was frowning thoughtfully suddenly he shot a question at mr opalsen this necklaceit was without doubt insured mr opalsen looked a trifle surprised at the question yes he said hesitatingly that is so but what does that matter broke in mrs opalsen tearfully its my necklace i want it was unique no money could be the same i comprehend madame said poirot soothingly i comprehend perfectly to la femme sentiment is everythingis it not so but monsieur who has not the so fine susceptibility will doubtless find some slight consolation in the fact of course of course said mr opalsen rather uncertainly still he was interrupted by a shout of triumph from the inspector he came in dangling something from his fingers with a cry mrs opalsen heaved herself up from her chair she was a changed woman oh oh my necklace she clasped it to her breast with both hands we crowded round where was it demanded opalsen maids bed in among the springs of the wire mattress she must have stolen it and hidden it there before the chambermaid arrived on the scene you permit madame said poirot gently he took the necklace from her and examined it closely then handed it back with a bow im afraid madam youll have to hand it over to us for the time being said the inspector we shall want it for the charge but it shall be returned to you as soon as possible mr opalsen frowned is that necessary im afraid so sir just a formality oh let him take it ed cried his wife id feel safer if he did i shouldnt sleep a wink thinking some one else might try and get hold of it that wretched girl and i would never have believed it of her there there my dear dont take on so i felt a gentle pressure on my arm it was poirot shall we slip away my friend i think our services are no longer needed once outside however he hesitated and then much to my surprise he remarked i should rather like to see the room next door the door was not locked and we entered the room which was a large double one was unoccupied dust lay about rather noticeably and my sensitive friend gave a characteristic grimace as he ran his finger round a rectangular mark on a table near the window the service leaves to be desired he observed dryly he was staring thoughtfully out of the window and seemed to have fallen into a brown study well i demanded impatiently what did we come in here for he started je vous demande pardon mon ami i wished to see if the door was really bolted on this side also well i said glancing at the door which communicated with the room we had just left it is bolted poirot nodded he still seemed to be thinking and anyway i continued what does it matter the case is over i wish youd had more chance of distinguishing yourself but it was the kind of case that even a stiffbacked idiot like that inspector couldnt go wrong over poirot shook his head the case is not over my friend it will not be over until we find out who stole the pearls but the maid did why do you say that why i stammered they were foundactually in her mattress ta ta ta said poirot impatiently those were not the pearls what imitation mon ami the statement took my breath away poirot was smiling placidly the good inspector obviously knows nothing of jewels but presently there will be a fine hullabaloo come i cried dragging at his arm where we must tell the opalsens at once i think not but that poor woman eh bien that poor woman as you call her will have a much better night believing the jewels to be safe but the thief may escape with them as usual my friend you speak without reflection how do you know that the pearls mrs opalsen locked up so carefully tonight were not the false ones and that the real robbery did not take place at a much earlier date oh i said bewildered exactly said poirot beaming we start again he led the way out of the room paused a moment as though considering and then walked down to the end of the corridor stopping outside the small den where the chambermaids and valets of the respective floors congregated our particular chambermaid appeared to be holding a small court there and to be retailing her late experiences to an appreciative audience she stopped in the middle of a sentence poirot bowed with his usual politeness excuse that i derange you but i shall be obliged if you will unlock for me the door of mr opalsens room the woman rose willingly and we accompanied her down the passage again mr opalsens room was on the other side of the corridor its door facing that of his wifes room the chambermaid unlocked it with her passkey and we entered as she was about to depart poirot detained her one moment have you ever seen among the effects of mr opalsen a card like this he held out a plain white card rather highly glazed and uncommon in appearance the maid took it and scrutinized it carefully no sir i cant say i have but anyway the valet has most to do with the gentlemens rooms i see thank you poirot took back the card the woman departed poirot appeared to reflect a little then he gave a short sharp nod of the head ring the bell i pray of you hastings three times for the valet i obeyed devoured with curiosity meanwhile poirot had emptied the wastepaperbasket on the floor and was swiftly going through its contents in a few moments the valet answered the bell to him poirot put the same question and handed him the card to examine but the response was the same the valet had never seen a card of that particular quality among mr opalsens belongings poirot thanked him and he withdrew somewhat unwillingly with an inquisitive glance at the overturned wastepaperbasket and the litter on the floor he could hardly have helped overhearing poirots thoughtful remark as he bundled the torn papers back again and the necklace was heavily insured    poirot i cried  i see you see nothing my friend he replied quickly as usual nothing at all it is incrediblebut there it is let us return to our own apartments we did so in silence once there to my intense surprise poirot effected a rapid change of clothing i go to london tonight he explained it is imperative what absolutely the real work that of the brain ah those brave little grey cells it is done i go to seek the confirmation i shall find it impossible to deceive hercule poirot youll come a cropper one of these days i observed rather disgusted by his vanity do not be enraged i beg of you mon ami i count on you to do me a serviceof your friendship of course i said eagerly rather ashamed of my moroseness what is it the sleeve of my coat that i have taken offwill you brush it see you a little white powder has clung to it you without doubt observed me run my finger round the drawer of the dressingtable no i didnt you should observe my actions my friend thus i obtained the powder on my finger and being a little overexcited i rubbed it on my sleeve an action without method which i deplorefalse to all my principles but what was the powder i asked not particularly interested in poirots principles not the poison of the borgias replied poirot with a twinkle i see your imagination mounting i should say it was french chalk french chalk yes cabinetmakers use it to make drawers run smoothly i laughed you old sinner i thought you were working up to something exciting au revoir my friend i save myself i fly the door shut behind him with a smile half of derision half of affection i picked up the coat and stretched out my hand for the clothesbrush                      the next morning hearing nothing from poirot i went out for a stroll met some old friends and lunched with them at their hotel in the afternoon we went for a spin a punctured tyre delayed us and it was past eight when i got back to the grand metropolitan the first sight that met my eyes was poirot looking even more diminutive than usual sandwiched between the opalsens beaming in a state of placid satisfaction mon ami hastings he cried and sprang to meet me embrace me my friend all has marched to a marvel luckily the embrace was merely figurativenot a thing one is always sure of with poirot do you mean i began just wonderful i call it said mrs opalsen smiling all over her fat face didnt i tell you ed that if he couldnt get back my pearls nobody would you did my dear you did and you were right i looked helplessly at poirot and he answered the glance my friend hastings is as you say in england all at the seaside seat yourself and i will recount to you all the affair that has so happily ended ended but yes they are arrested who are arrested the chambermaid and the valet parbleu you did not suspect not with my parting hint about the french chalk you said cabinetmakers used it certainly they doto make drawers slide easily somebody wanted that drawer to slide in and out without any noise who could that be obviously only the chambermaid the plan was so ingenious that it did not at once leap to the eyenot even to the eye of hercule poirot listen this was how it was done the valet was in the empty room next door waiting the french maid leaves the room quick as a flash the chambermaid whips open the drawer takes out the jewelcase and slipping back the bolt passes it through the door the valet opens it at his leisure with the duplicate key with which he has provided himself extracts the necklace and waits his time clestine leaves the room again andpstin a flash the case is passed back again and replaced in the drawer madame arrives the theft is discovered the chambermaid demands to be searched with a good deal of righteous indignation and leaves the room without a stain on her character the imitation necklace with which they have provided themselves has been concealed in the french girls bed that morning by the chambermaida master stroke a but what did you go to london for you remember the card certainly it puzzled meand puzzles me still i thought i hesitated delicately glancing at mr opalsen poirot laughed heartily une blague for the benefit of the valet the card was one with a specially prepared surfacefor fingerprints i went straight to scotland yard asked for our old friend inspector japp and laid the facts before him as i had suspected the fingerprints proved to be those of two wellknown jewel thieves who have been wanted for some time japp came down with me the thieves were arrested and the necklace was discovered in the valets possession a clever pair but they failed in method have i not told you hastings at least thirtysix times that without method at least thirtysix thousand times i interrupted but where did their method break down mon ami it is a good plan to take a place as chambermaid or valetbut you must not shirk your work they left an empty room undusted and therefore when the man put down the jewelcase on the little table near the communicating door it left a square mark i remember i cried before i was undecided theni knew there was a moments silence and ive got my pearls said mrs opalsen as a sort of greek chorus well i said id better have some dinner poirot accompanied me this ought to mean kudos for you i observed pas du tout replied poirot tranquilly japp and the local inspector will divide the credit between them buthe tapped his pocketi have a cheque here from mr opalsen and how say you my friend this weekend has not gone according to plan shall we return here next weekendat my expense this time   viii   the kidnapped prime minister now that war and the problems of war are things of the past i think i may safely venture to reveal to the world the part which my friend poirot played in a moment of national crisis the secret has been well guarded not a whisper of it reached the press but now that the need for secrecy has gone by i feel it is only just that england should know the debt it owes to my quaint little friend whose marvellous brain so ably averted a great catastrophe one evening after dinneri will not particularize the date it suffices to say that it was at the time when peace by negotiation was the parrotcry of englands enemiesmy friend and i were sitting in his rooms after being invalided out of the army i had been given a recruiting job and it had become my custom to drop in on poirot in the evenings after dinner and talk with him of any cases of interest that he might have on hand i was attempting to discuss with him the sensational news of that dayno less than an attempted assassination of mr david macadam englands prime minister the account in the papers had evidently been carefully censored no details were given save that the prime minister had had a marvellous escape the bullet just grazing his cheek i considered that our police must have been shamefully careless for such an outrage to be possible i could well understand that the german agents in england would be willing to risk much for such an achievement fighting mac as his own party had nicknamed him had strenuously and unequivocally combated the pacifist influence which was becoming so prevalent he was more than englands prime ministerhe was england and to have removed him from his sphere of influence would have been a crushing and paralysing blow to britain poirot was busy mopping a grey suit with a minute sponge never was there a dandy such as hercule poirot neatness and order were his passion now with the odour of benzine filling the air he was quite unable to give me his full attention in a little minute i am with you my friend i have all but finished the spot of greasehe is not goodi remove himso he waved his sponge i smiled as i lit another cigarette anything interesting on i inquired after a minute or two i assist ahow do you call itcharlady to find her husband a difficult affair needing the tact for i have a little idea that when he is found he will not be pleased what would you for my part i sympathize with him he was a man of discrimination to lose himself i laughed at last the spot of grease he is gone i am at your disposal i was asking you what you thought of this attempt to assassinate macadam enfantillage replied poirot promptly one can hardly take it seriously to fire with the riflenever does it succeed it is a device of the past it was very near succeeding this time i reminded him poirot shook his head impatiently he was about to reply when the landlady thrust her head round the door and informed him that there were two gentlemen below who wanted to see him they wont give their names sir but they says as its very important let them mount said poirot carefully folding his grey trousers in a few minutes the two visitors were ushered in and my heart gave a leap as in the foremost i recognized no less a personage than lord estair leader of the house of commons whilst his companion mr bernard dodge was also a member of the war cabinet and as i knew a close personal friend of the prime minister monsieur poirot said lord estair interrogatively my friend bowed the great man looked at me and hesitated my business is private you may speak freely before captain hastings said my friend nodding to me to remain he has not all the gifts no but i answer for his discretion lord estair still hesitated but mr dodge broke in abruptly oh come ondont lets beat about the bush as far as i can see the whole of england will know the hole were in soon enough times everything pray be seated messieurs said poirot politely will you take the big chair milord lord estair started slightly you know me poirot smiled certainly i read the little papers with the pictures how should i not know you monsieur poirot i have come to consult you upon a matter of the most vital urgency i must ask for absolute secrecy you have the word of hercule poiroti can say no more said my friend grandiloquently it concerns the prime minister we are in grave trouble were up a tree interposed mr dodge the injury is serious then i asked what injury the bullet wound oh that cried mr dodge contemptuously thats old history as my colleague says continued lord estair that affair is over and done with luckily it failed i wished i could say as much for the second attempt there has been a second attempt then yes though not of the same nature monsieur poirot the prime minister has disappeared what he has been kidnapped impossible i cried stupefied poirot threw a withering glance at me which i knew enjoined me to keep my mouth shut unfortunately impossible as it seems it is only too true continued his lordship poirot looked at mr dodge you said just now monsieur that time was everything what did you mean by that the two men exchanged glances and then lord estair said you have heard monsieur poirot of the approaching allied conference my friend nodded for obvious reasons no details have been given of when and where it is to take place but although it has been kept out of the newspapers the date is of course widely known in diplomatic circles the conference is to be held tomorrowthursdayevening at versailles now you perceive the terrible gravity of the situation i will not conceal from you that the prime ministers presence at the conference is a vital necessity the pacifist propaganda started and maintained by the german agents in our midst has been very active it is the universal opinion that the turning point of the conference will be the strong personality of the prime minister his absence may have the most serious resultspossibly a premature and disastrous peace and we have no one who can be sent in his place he alone can represent england poirots face had grown very grave then you regard the kidnapping of the prime minister as a direct attempt to prevent his being present at the conference most certainly i do he was actually on his way to france at the time and the conference is to be held at nine oclock tomorrow night poirot drew an enormous watch from his pocket it is now a quarter to nine twentyfour hours said mr dodge thoughtfully and a quarter amended poirot do not forget the quarter monsieurit may come in useful now for the detailsthe abduction did it take place in england or in france in france mr macadam crossed to france this morning he was to stay tonight as the guest of the commanderinchief proceeding tomorrow to paris he was conveyed across the channel by destroyer at boulogne he was met by a car from general headquarters and one of the commanderinchiefs adcs eh bien well they started from boulognebut they never arrived what monsieur poirot it was a bogus car and a bogus adc the real car was found in a side road with the chauffeur and the adc neatly gagged and bound and the bogus car is still at large poirot made a gesture of impatience incredible surely it cannot escape attention for long so we thought it seemed merely a question of searching thoroughly that part of france is under military law we were convinced that the car could not go long unnoticed the french police and our own scotland yard men and the military are straining every nerve it is as you say incrediblebut nothing has been discovered at that moment a tap came at the door and a young officer entered with a heavily sealed envelope which he handed to lord estair just through from france sir i brought it on here as you directed the minister tore it open eagerly and uttered an exclamation the officer withdrew here is news at last this telegram has just been decoded they have found the second car also the secretary daniels chloroformed gagged and bound in an abandoned farm near c he remembers nothing except something being pressed against his mouth and nose from behind and struggling to free himself the police are satisfied as to the genuineness of his statement and they have found nothing else no not the prime ministers dead body then there is hope but it is strange why after trying to shoot him this morning are they now taking so much trouble to keep him alive dodge shook his head one things quite certain theyre determined at all costs to prevent his attending the conference if it is humanly possible the prime minister shall be there god grant it is not too late now messieurs recount to me everythingfrom the beginning i must know about this shooting affair as well last night the prime minister accompanied by one of his secretaries captain daniels the same who accompanied him to france yes as i was saying they motored down to windsor where the prime minister was granted an audience early this morning he returned to town and it was on the way that the attempted assassination took place one moment if you please who is this captain daniels you have his dossier lord estair smiled i thought you would ask me that we do not know very much of him he is of no particular family he has served in the english army and is an extremely able secretary being an exceptionally fine linguist i believe he speaks seven languages it is for that reason that the prime minister chose him to accompany him to france has he any relatives in england two aunts a mrs everard who lives at hampstead and a miss daniels who lives near ascot ascot that is near to windsor is it not that point has not been overlooked but it has led to nothing you regard the capitaine daniels then as above suspicion a shade of bitterness crept into lord estairs voice as he replied no monsieur poirot in these days i should hesitate before i pronounced anyone above suspicion trs bien now i understand milord that the prime minister would as a matter of course be under vigilant police protection which ought to render any assault upon him an impossibility lord estair bowed his head that is so the prime ministers car was closely followed by another car containing detectives in plain clothes mr macadam knew nothing of these precautions he is personally a most fearless man and would be inclined to sweep them away arbitrarily but naturally the police make their own arrangements in fact the premiers chauffeur omurphy is a cid man omurphy that is a name of ireland is it not so yes he is an irishman from what part of ireland county clare i believe tiens but proceed milord the premier started for london the car was a closed one he and captain daniels sat inside the second car followed as usual but unluckily for some unknown reason the prime ministers car deviated from the main road at a point where the road curves interrupted poirot yesbut how did you know oh cest vident continue for some unknown reason continued lord estair the premiers car left the main road the police car unaware of the deviation continued to keep to the high road at a short distance down the unfrequented lane the prime ministers car was suddenly held up by a band of masked men the chauffeur that brave omurphy murmured poirot thoughtfully the chauffeur momentarily taken aback jammed on the brakes the prime minister put his head out of the window instantly a shot rang outthen another the first one grazed his cheek the second fortunately went wide the chauffeur now realizing the danger instantly forged straight ahead scattering the band of men a near escape i ejaculated with a shiver mr macadam refused to make any fuss over the slight wound he had received he declared it was only a scratch he stopped at a local cottage hospital where it was dressed and bound uphe did not of course reveal his identity he then drove as per schedule straight to charing cross where a special train for dover was awaiting him and after a brief account of what had happened had been given to the anxious police by captain daniels he duly departed for france at dover he went on board the waiting destroyer at boulogne as you know the bogus car was waiting for him carrying the union jack and correct in every detail that is all you have to tell me yes there is no other circumstance that you have omitted milord well there is one rather peculiar thing yes the prime ministers car did not return home after leaving the prime minister at charing cross the police were anxious to interview omurphy so a search was instituted at once the car was discovered standing outside a certain unsavoury little restaurant in soho which is well known as a meetingplace of german agents and the chauffeur the chauffeur was nowhere to be found he too had disappeared so said poirot thoughtfully there are two disappearances the prime minister in france and omurphy in london he looked keenly at lord estair who made a gesture of despair i can only tell you monsieur poirot that if anyone had suggested to me yesterday that omurphy was a traitor i should have laughed in his face and today today i do not know what to think poirot nodded gravely he looked at his turnip of a watch again i understand that i have carte blanche messieursin every way i mean i must be able to go where i choose and how i choose perfectly there is a special train leaving for dover in an hours time with a further contingent from scotland yard you shall be accompanied by a military officer and a cid man who will hold themselves at your disposal in every way is that satisfactory quite one more question before you leave messieurs what made you come to me i am unknown obscure in this great london of yours we sought you out on the express recommendation and wish of a very great man of your own country comment my old friend the prfet lord estair shook his head one higher than the prfet one whose word was once law in belgiumand shall be again that england has sworn poirots hand flew swiftly to a dramatic salute amen to that ah but my master does not forget    messieurs i hercule poirot will serve you faithfully heaven only send that it will be in time but this is darkdark    i cannot see well poirot i cried impatiently as the door closed behind the ministers what do you think my friend was busy packing a minute suitcase with quick deft movements he shook his head thoughtfully i do not know what to think my brains desert me why as you said kidnap him when a knock on the head would do as well i mused pardon me mon ami but i did not quite say that it is undoubtedly far more their affair to kidnap him but why because uncertainty creates panic that is one reason were the prime minister dead it would be a terrible calamity but the situation would have to be faced but now you have paralysis will the prime minister reappear or will he not is he dead or alive nobody knows and until they know nothing definite can be done and as i tell you uncertainty breeds panic which is what les boches are playing for then again if the kidnappers are holding him secretly somewhere they have the advantage of being able to make terms with both sides the german government is not a liberal paymaster as a rule but no doubt they can be made to disgorge substantial remittances in such a case as this thirdly they run no risk of the hangmans rope oh decidedly kidnapping is their affair then if that is so why should they first try to shoot him poirot made a gesture of anger ah that is just what i do not understand it is inexplicablestupid they have all their arrangements made and very good arrangements too for the abduction and yet they imperil the whole affair by a melodramatic attack worthy of a cinema and quite as unreal it is almost impossible to believe in it with its band of masked men not twenty miles from london perhaps they were two quite separate attempts which happened irrespective of each other i suggested ah no that would be too much of a coincidence then furtherwho is the traitor there must have been a traitorin the first affair anyway but who was itdaniels or omurphy it must have been one of the two or why did the car leave the main road we cannot suppose that the prime minister connived at his own assassination did omurphy take that turning of his own accord or was it daniels who told him to do so surely it must have been omurphys doing yes because if it was daniels the prime minister would have heard the order and would have asked the reason but there are altogether too many whys in this affair and they contradict each other if omurphy is an honest man why did he leave the main road but if he was a dishonest man why did he start the car again when only two shots had been firedthereby in all probability saving the prime ministers life and again if he was honest why did he immediately on leaving charing cross drive to a wellknown rendezvous of german spies it looks bad i said let us look at the case with method what have we for and against these two men take omurphy first against that his conduct in leaving the main road was suspicious that he is an irishman from county clare that he has disappeared in a highly suggestive manner for that his promptness in restarting the car saved the premiers life that he is a scotland yard man and obviously from the post allotted to him a trusted detective now for daniels there is not much against him except the fact that nothing is known of his antecedents and that he speaks too many languages for a good englishman pardon me mon ami but as linguists you are deplorable now for him we have the fact that he was found gagged bound and chloroformedwhich does not look as though he had anything to do with the matter he might have gagged and bound himself to divert suspicion poirot shook his head the french police would make no mistake of that kind besides once he had attained his object and the prime minister was safely abducted there would not be much point in his remaining behind his accomplices could have gagged and chloroformed him of course but i fail to see what object they hoped to accomplish by it he can be of little use to them now for until the circumstances concerning the prime minister have been cleared up he is bound to be closely watched perhaps he hoped to start the police on a false scent then why did he not do so he merely says that something was pressed over his nose and mouth and that he remembers nothing more there is no false scent there it sounds remarkably like the truth well i said glancing at the clock i suppose wed better start for the station you may find more clues in france possibly mon ami but i doubt it it is still incredible to me that the prime minister has not been discovered in that limited area where the difficulty of concealing him must be tremendous if the military and the police of two countries have not found him how shall i at charing cross we were met by mr dodge this is detective barnes of scotland yard and major norman they will hold themselves entirely at your disposal good luck to you its a bad business but ive not given up hope must be off now and the minister strode rapidly away we chatted in a desultory fashion with major norman in the centre of the little group of men on the platform i recognized a little ferretfaced fellow talking to a tall fair man he was an old acquaintance of poirotsdetectiveinspector japp supposed to be one of the smartest of scotland yards officers he came over and greeted my friend cheerfully i heard you were on this job too smart bit of work so far theyve got away with the goods all right but i cant believe they can keep him hidden long our people are going through france with a toothcomb so are the french i cant help feeling its only a matter of hours now that is if hes still alive remarked the tall detective gloomily japps face fell yes    but somehow ive got the feeling hes alive all right poirot nodded yes yes hes alive but can he be found in time i like you did not believe he could be hidden so long the whistle blew and we all trooped up into the pullman car then with a slow unwilling jerk the train drew out of the station it was a curious journey the scotland yard men crowded together maps of northern france were spread out and eager forefingers traced the lines of roads and villages each man had his own pet theory poirot showed none of his usual loquacity but sat staring in front of him with an expression on his face that reminded me of a puzzled child i talked to norman whom i found quite an amusing fellow on arriving at dover poirots behaviour moved me to intense amusement the little man as he went on board the boat clutched desperately at my arm the wind was blowing lustily mon dieu he murmured this is terrible have courage poirot i cried you will succeed you will find him i am sure of it ah mon ami you mistake my emotion it is this villainous sea that troubles me the mal de merit is horrible suffering oh i said rather taken aback the first throb of the engines was felt and poirot groaned and closed his eyes major norman has a map of northern france if you would like to study it poirot shook his head impatiently but no but no leave me my friend see you to think the stomach and the brain must be in harmony laverguier has a method most excellent for averting the mal de mer you breathe inand outslowly soturning the head from left to right and counting six between each breath i left him to his gymnastic endeavours and went on deck as we came slowly into boulogne harbour poirot appeared neat and smiling and announced to me in a whisper that laverguiers system had succeeded to a marvel japps forefinger was still tracing imaginary routes on his map nonsense the car started from boulognehere they branched off now my idea is that they transferred the prime minister to another car see well said the tall detective i shall make for the seaports ten to one theyve smuggled him on board a ship japp shook his head too obvious the order went out at once to close all the ports the day was just breaking as we landed major norman touched poirot on the arm theres a military car here waiting for you sir thank you monsieur but for the moment i do not propose to leave boulogne what no we will enter this hotel here by the quay he suited the action to the word demanded and was accorded a private room we three followed him puzzled and uncomprehending he shot a quick glance at us it is not so that the good detective should act eh i perceive your thought he must be full of energy he must rush to and fro he should prostrate himself on the dusty road and seek the marks of tyres through a little glass he must gather up the cigaretteend the fallen match that is your idea is it not his eyes challenged us but ihercule poirottell you that it is not so the true clues are withinhere he tapped his forehead see you i need not have left london it would have been sufficient for me to sit quietly in my rooms there all that matters is the little grey cells within secretly and silently they do their part until suddenly i call for a map and i lay my finger on a spotsoand i say the prime minister is there and it is so with method and logic one can accomplish anything this frantic rushing to france was a mistakeit is playing a childs game of hideandseek but now though it may be too late i will set to work the right way from within silence my friends i beg of you and for five long hours the little man sat motionless blinking his eyelids like a cat his green eyes flickering and becoming steadily greener and greener the scotland yard man was obviously contemptuous major norman was bored and impatient and i myself found the time pass with wearisome slowness finally i got up and strolled as noiselessly as i could to the window the matter was becoming a farce i was secretly concerned for my friend if he failed i would have preferred him to fail in a less ridiculous manner out of the window i idly watched the daily leave boat belching forth columns of smoke as she lay alongside the quay suddenly i was aroused by poirots voice close to my elbow mes amis let us start i turned an extraordinary transformation had come over my friend his eyes were flickering with excitement his chest was swelled to the uttermost i have been an imbecile my friends but i see daylight at last major norman moved hastily to the door ill order the car there is no need i shall not use it thank heaven the wind has fallen do you mean you are going to walk sir no my young friend i am no st peter i prefer to cross the sea by boat to cross the sea yes to work with method one must begin from the beginning and the beginning of this affair was in england therefore we return to england                      at three oclock we stood once more upon charing cross platform to all our expostulations poirot turned a deaf ear and reiterated again and again that to start at the beginning was not a waste of time but the only way on the way over he had conferred with norman in a low voice and the latter had despatched a sheaf of telegrams from dover owing to the special passes held by norman we got through everywhere in record time in london a large police car was waiting for us with some plainclothes men one of whom handed a typewritten sheet of paper to my friend he answered my inquiring glance a list of the cottage hospitals within a certain radius west of london i wired for it from dover we were whirled rapidly through the london streets we were on the bath road on we went through hammersmith chiswick and brentford i began to see our objective through windsor and on to ascot my heart gave a leap ascot was where daniels had an aunt living we were after him then not omurphy we duly stopped at the gate of a trim villa poirot jumped out and rang the bell i saw a perplexed frown dimming the radiance of his face plainly he was not satisfied the bell was answered he was ushered inside in a few moments he reappeared and climbed into the car with a short sharp shake of his head my hopes began to die down it was past four now even if he found certain evidence incriminating daniels what would be the good of it unless he could wring from some one the exact spot in france where they were holding the prime minister our return progress towards london was an interrupted one we deviated from the main road more than once and occasionally stopped at a small building which i had no difficulty in recognizing as a cottage hospital poirot only spent a few minutes at each but at every halt his radiant assurance was more and more restored he whispered something to norman to which the latter replied yes if you turn off to the left you will find them waiting by the bridge we turned up a side road and in the failing light i discerned a second car waiting by the side of the road it contained two men in plain clothes poirot got down and spoke to them and then we started off in a northerly direction the other car following close behind we drove for some time our objective being obviously one of the northern suburbs of london finally we drove up to the front door of a tall house standing a little back from the road in its own grounds norman and i were left with the car poirot and one of the detectives went up to the door and rang a neat parlourmaid opened it the detective spoke i am a police officer and i have a warrant to search this house the girl gave a little scream and a tall handsome woman of middleage appeared behind her in the hall shut the door edith they are burglars i expect but poirot swiftly inserted his foot in the door and at the same moment blew a whistle instantly the other detectives ran up and poured into the house shutting the door behind them norman and i spent about five minutes cursing our forced inactivity finally the door reopened and the men emerged escorting three prisonersa woman and two men the woman and one of the men were taken to the second car the other man was placed in our car by poirot himself i must go with the others my friend but have great care of this gentleman you do not know him no eh bien let me present to you monsieur omurphy omurphy i gaped at him openmouthed as we started again he was not handcuffed but i did not fancy he would try to escape he sat there staring in front of him as though dazed anyway norman and i would be more than a match for him to my surprise we still kept a northerly route we were not returning to london then i was much puzzled suddenly as the car slowed down i recognized that we were close to hendon aerodrome immediately i grasped poirots idea he proposed to reach france by aeroplane it was a sporting idea but on the face of it impracticable a telegram would be far quicker time was everything he must leave the personal glory of rescuing the prime minister to others as we drew up major norman jumped out and a plainclothes man took his place he conferred with poirot for a few minutes and then went off briskly i too jumped out and caught poirot by the arm i congratulate you old fellow they have told you the hidingplace but look here you must wire to france at once youll be too late if you go yourself poirot looked at me curiously for a minute or two unfortunately my friend there are some things that cannot be sent by telegram                      at that moment major norman returned accompanied by a young officer in the uniform of the flying corps this is captain lyall who will fly you over to france he can start at once wrap up warmly sir said the young pilot i can lend you a coat if you like poirot was consulting his enormous watch he murmured to himself yes there is timejust time then he looked up and bowed politely to the young officer i thank you monsieur but it is not i who am your passenger it is this gentleman here he moved a little aside as he spoke and a figure came forward out of the darkness it was the second male prisoner who had gone in the other car and as the light fell on his face i gave a gasp of surprise it was the prime minister                      for heavens sake tell me all about it i cried impatiently as poirot norman and i motored back to london how in the world did they manage to smuggle him back to england there was no need to smuggle him back replied poirot dryly the prime minister has never left england he was kidnapped on his way from windsor to london what i will make all clear the prime minister was in his car his secretary beside him suddenly a pad of chloroform is clapped on his face but by whom by the clever linguistic captain daniels as soon as the prime minister is unconscious daniels picks up the speakingtube and directs omurphy to turn to the right which the chauffeur quite unsuspicious does a few yards down that unfrequented road a large car is standing apparently broken down its driver signals to omurphy to stop omurphy slows up the stranger approaches daniels leans out of the window and probably with the aid of an instantaneous ansthetic such as ethylchloride the chloroform trick is repeated in a few seconds the two helpless men are dragged out and transferred to the other car and a pair of substitutes take their places impossible pas du tout have you not seen musichall turns imitating celebrities with marvellous accuracy nothing is easier than to personate a public character the prime minister of england is far easier to understudy than mr john smith of clapham say as for omurphys double no one was going to take much notice of him until after the departure of the prime minister and by then he would have made himself scarce he drives straight from charing cross to the meetingplace of his friends he goes in as omurphy he emerges as some one quite different omurphy has disappeared leaving a conveniently suspicious trail behind him but the man who personated the prime minister was seen by every one he was not seen by anyone who knew him privately or intimately and daniels shielded him from contact with anyone as much as possible moreover his face was bandaged up and anything unusual in his manner would be put down to the fact that he was suffering from shock as a result of the attempt upon his life mr macadam has a weak throat and always spares his voice as much as possible before any great speech the deception was perfectly easy to keep up as far as france there it would be impracticable and impossibleso the prime minister disappears the police of this country hurry across the channel and no one bothers to go into the details of the first attack to sustain the illusion that the abduction has taken place in france daniels is gagged and chloroformed in a convincing manner and the man who has enacted the part of the prime minister rids himself of his disguise he and the bogus chauffeur may be arrested as suspicious characters but no one will dream of suspecting their real part in the drama and they will eventually be released for lack of evidence and the real prime minister he and omurphy were driven straight to the house of mrs everard at hampstead daniels socalled aunt in reality she is frau bertha ebenthal and the police have been looking for her for some time it is a valuable little present that i have made to themto say nothing of daniels ah it was a clever plan but he did not reckon on the cleverness of hercule poirot i think my friend might well be excused his moment of vanity when did you first begin to suspect the truth of the matter when i began to work the right wayfrom within i could not make that shooting affair fit inbut when i saw that the net result of it was that the prime minister went to france with his face bound up i began to comprehend and when i visited all the cottage hospitals between windsor and london and found that no one answering to my description had had his face bound up and dressed that morning i was sure after that it was childsplay for a mind like mine                      the following morning poirot showed me a telegram he had just received it had no place of origin and was unsigned it ran in time later in the day the evening papers published an account of the allied conference they laid particular stress on the magnificent ovation accorded to mr david macadam whose inspiring speech had produced a deep and lasting impression   ix   the disappearance of mr davenheim poirot and i were expecting our old friend inspector japp of scotland yard to tea we were sitting round the teatable awaiting his arrival poirot had just finished carefully straightening the cups and saucers which our landlady was in the habit of throwing rather than placing on the table he had also breathed heavily on the metal teapot and polished it with a silk handkerchief the kettle was on the boil and a small enamel saucepan beside it contained some thick sweet chocolate which was more to poirots palate than what he described as your english poison a sharp rattat sounded below and a few minutes afterwards japp entered briskly hope im not late he said as he greeted us to tell the truth i was yarning with miller the man whos in charge of the davenheim case i pricked up my ears for the last three days the papers had been full of the strange disappearance of mr davenheim senior partner of davenheim and salmon the wellknown bankers and financiers on saturday last he had walked out of his house and had never been seen since i looked forward to extracting some interesting details from japp i should have thought i remarked that it would be almost impossible for anyone to disappear nowadays poirot moved a plate of bread and butter the eighth of an inch and said sharply be exact my friend what do you mean by disappear to which class of disappearance are you referring are disappearances classified and labelled then i laughed japp smiled also poirot frowned at us both but certainly they are they fall into three categories first and most common the voluntary disappearance second the much abused loss of memory caserare but occasionally genuine third murder and a more or less successful disposal of the body do you refer to all three as impossible of execution very nearly so i should think you might lose your own memory but some one would be sure to recognize youespecially in the case of a wellknown man like davenheim then bodies cant be made to vanish into thin air sooner or later they turn up concealed in lonely places or in trunks murder will out in the same way the absconding clerk or the domestic defaulter is bound to be run down in these days of wireless telegraphy he can be headed off from foreign countries ports and railway stations are watched and as for concealment in this country his features and appearance will be known to every one who reads a daily newspaper hes up against civilization mon ami said poirot you make one error you do not allow for the fact that a man who had decided to make away with another manor with himself in a figurative sensemight be that rare machine a man of method he might bring intelligence talent a careful calculation of detail to the task and then i do not see why he should not be successful in baffling the police force but not you i suppose said japp goodhumouredly winking at me he couldnt baffle you eh monsieur poirot poirot endeavoured with a marked lack of success to look modest me also why not it is true that i approach such problems with an exact science a mathematical precision which seems alas only too rare in the new generation of detectives japp grinned more widely i dont know he said miller the man whos on this case is a smart chap you may be very sure he wont overlook a footprint or a cigarash or a crumb even hes got eyes that see everything so mon ami said poirot has the london sparrow but all the same i should not ask the little brown bird to solve the problem of mr davenheim come now monsieur youre not going to run down the value of details as clues by no means these things are all good in their way the danger is they may assume undue importance most details are insignificant one or two are vital it is the brain the little grey cellshe tapped his foreheadon which one must rely the senses mislead one must seek the truth withinnot without you dont mean to say monsieur poirot that you would undertake to solve a case without moving from your chair do you that is exactly what i do meangranted the facts were placed before me i regard myself as a consulting specialist japp slapped his knee hanged if i dont take you at your word bet you a fiver that you cant lay your handor rather tell me where to lay my handon mr davenheim dead or alive before a week is out poirot considered eh bien mon ami i accept le sport it is the passion of you english nowthe facts on saturday last as is his usual custom mr davenheim took the  train from victoria to chingside where his palatial country place the cedars is situated after lunch he strolled round the grounds and gave various directions to the gardeners everybody agrees that his manner was absolutely normal and as usual after tea he put his head into his wifes boudoir saying that he was going to stroll down to the village and post some letters he added that he was expecting a mr lowen on business if he should come before he himself returned he was to be shown into the study and asked to wait mr davenheim then left the house by the front door passed leisurely down the drive and out at the gate andwas never seen again from that hour he vanished completely prettyvery prettyaltogether a charming little problem murmured poirot proceed my good friend about a quarter of an hour later a tall dark man with a thick black moustache rang the frontdoor bell and explained that he had an appointment with mr davenheim he gave the name of lowen and in accordance with the bankers instructions was shown into the study nearly an hour passed mr davenheim did not return finally mr lowen rang the bell and explained that he was unable to wait any longer as he must catch his train back to town mrs davenheim apologized for her husbands absence which seemed unaccountable as she knew him to have been expecting the visitor mr lowen reiterated his regrets and took his departure well as every one knows mr davenheim did not return early on sunday morning the police were communicated with but could make neither head nor tail of the matter mr davenheim seemed literally to have vanished into thin air he had not been to the post office nor had he been seen passing through the village at the station they were positive he had not departed by any train his own motor had not left the garage if he had hired a car to meet him in some lonely spot it seems almost certain that by this time in view of the large reward offered for information the driver of it would have come forward to tell what he knew true there was a small racemeeting at entfield five miles away and if he had walked to that station he might have passed unnoticed in the crowd but since then his photograph and a full description of him have been circulated in every newspaper and nobody has been able to give any news of him we have of course received many letters from all over england but each clue so far has ended in disappointment on monday morning a further sensational discovery came to light behind a portire in mr davenheims study stands a safe and that safe had been broken into and rifled the windows were fastened securely on the inside which seems to put an ordinary burglary out of court unless of course an accomplice within the house fastened them again afterwards on the other hand sunday having intervened and the household being in a state of chaos it is likely that the burglary was committed on the saturday and remained undetected until monday prcisment said poirot dryly well is he arrested ce pauvre m lowen japp grinned not yet but hes under pretty close supervision poirot nodded what was taken from the safe have you any idea weve been going into that with the junior partner of the firm and mrs davenheim apparently there was a considerable amount in bearer bonds and a very large sum in notes owing to some large transaction having been just carried through there was also a small fortune in jewellery all mrs davenheims jewels were kept in the safe the purchasing of them had become a passion with her husband of late years and hardly a month passed that he did not make her a present of some rare and costly gem altogether a good haul said poirot thoughtfully now what about lowen is it known what his business was with davenheim that evening well the two men were apparently not on very good terms lowen is a speculator in quite a small way nevertheless he has been able once or twice to score a coup off davenheim in the market though it seems they seldom or never actually met it was a matter concerning some south american shares which led the banker to make his appointment had davenheim interests in south america then i believe so mrs davenheim happened to mention that he spent all last autumn in buenos ayres any trouble in his home life were the husband and wife on good terms i should say his domestic life was quite peaceful and uneventful mrs davenheim is a pleasant rather unintelligent woman quite a nonentity i think then we must not look for the solution of the mystery there had he any enemies he had plenty of financial rivals and no doubt there are many people whom he has got the better of who bear him no particular goodwill but there was no one likely to make away with himand if they had where is the body exactly as hastings says bodies have a habit of coming to light with fatal persistency by the way one of the gardeners says he saw a figure going round to the side of the house toward the rosegarden the long french window of the study opens on to the rosegarden and mr davenheim frequently entered and left the house that way but the man was a good way off at work on some cucumber frames and cannot even say whether it was the figure of his master or not also he cannot fix the time with any accuracy it must have been before six as the gardeners cease work at that time and mr davenheim left the house about halfpast five or thereabouts what lies beyond the rosegarden a lake with a boathouse yes a couple of punts are kept there i suppose youre thinking of suicide monsieur poirot well i dont mind telling you that millers going down tomorrow expressly to see that piece of water dragged thats the kind of man he is poirot smiled faintly and turned to me hastings i pray you hand me that copy of the daily megaphone if i remember rightly there is an unusually clear photograph there of the missing man i rose and found the sheet required poirot studied the features attentively hm he murmured wears his hair rather long and wavy full moustache and pointed beard bushy eyebrows eyes dark yes hair and beard turning grey the detective nodded well monsieur poirot what have you got to say to it all clear as daylight eh on the contrary most obscure the scotland yard man looked pleased which gives me great hopes of solving it finished poirot placidly eh i find it a good sign when a case is obscure if a thing is clear as daylighteh bien mistrust it some one has made it so japp shook his head almost pityingly well each to their fancy but its not a bad thing to see your way clear ahead i do not see murmured poirot i shut my eyesand think japp sighed well youve got a clear week to think in and you will bring me any fresh developments that arisethe result of the labours of the hardworking and lynxeyed inspector miller for instance certainly thats in the bargain seems a shame doesnt it said japp to me as i accompanied him to the door like robbing a child i could not help agreeing with a smile i was still smiling as i reentered the room eh bien said poirot immediately you make fun of papa poirot is it not so he shook his finger at me you do not trust his grey cells ah do not be confused let us discuss this little problemincomplete as yet i admit but already showing one or two points of interest the lake i said significantly and even more than the lake the boathouse i looked sidewise at poirot he was smiling in his most inscrutable fashion i felt that for the moment it would be quite useless to question him further we heard nothing of japp until the following evening when he walked in about nine oclock i saw at once by his expression that he was bursting with news of some kind eh bien my friend remarked poirot all goes well but do not tell me that you have discovered the body of mr davenheim in your lake because i shall not believe you we havent found the body but we did find his clothesthe identical clothes he was wearing that day what do you say to that any other clothes missing from the house no his valet is quite positive on that point the rest of his wardrobe is intact theres more weve arrested lowen one of the maids whose business it is to fasten the bedroom windows declares that she saw lowen coming towards the study through the rosegarden about a quarter past six that would be about ten minutes before he left the house what does he himself say to that denied first of all that he had ever left the study but the maid was positive and he pretended afterwards that he had forgotten just stepping out of the window to examine an unusual species of rose rather a weak story and theres fresh evidence against him come to light mr davenheim always wore a thick gold ring set with a solitaire diamond on the little finger of his right hand well that ring was pawned in london on saturday night by a man called billy kellett hes already known to the policedid three months last autumn for lifting an old gentlemans watch it seems he tried to pawn the ring at no less than five different places succeeded at the last one got gloriously drunk on the proceeds assaulted a policeman and was run in in consequence i went to bow street with miller and saw him hes sober enough now and i dont mind admitting we pretty well frightened the life out of him hinting he might be charged with murder this is his yarn and a very queer one it is he was at entfield races on saturday though i dare say scarfpins was his line of business rather than betting anyway he had a bad day and was down on his luck he was tramping along the road to chingside and sat down in a ditch to rest just before he got into the village a few minutes later he noticed a man coming along the road to the village darkcomplexioned gent with a big moustache one of them city toffs is his description of the man kellett was half concealed from the road by a heap of stones just before he got abreast of him the man looked quickly up and down the road and seeing it apparently deserted he took a small object from his pocket and threw it over the hedge then he went on towards the station now the object he had thrown over the hedge had fallen with a slight chink which aroused the curiosity of the human derelict in the ditch he investigated and after a short search discovered the ring that is kelletts story its only fair to say that lowen denies it utterly and of course the word of a man like kellett cant be relied upon in the slightest its within the bounds of possibility that he met davenheim in the lane and robbed and murdered him poirot shook his head very improbable mon ami he had no means of disposing of the body it would have been found by now secondly the open way in which he pawned the ring makes it unlikely that he did murder to get it thirdly your sneakthief is rarely a murderer fourthly as he has been in prison since saturday it would be too much of a coincidence that he is able to give so accurate a description of lowen japp nodded i dont say youre not right but all the same you wont get a jury to take much note of a jailbirds evidence what seems odd to me is that lowen couldnt find a cleverer way of disposing of the ring poirot shrugged his shoulders well after all if it were found in the neighbourhood it might be argued that davenheim himself had dropped it but why remove it from the body at all i cried there might be a reason for that said japp do you know that just beyond the lake a little gate leads out on to the hill and not three minutes walk brings you towhat do you thinka lime kiln good heavens i cried you mean that the lime which destroyed the body would be powerless to affect the metal of the ring exactly it seems to me i said that that explains everything what a horrible crime by common consent we both turned and looked at poirot he seemed lost in reflection his brow knitted as though with some supreme mental effort i felt that at last his keen intellect was asserting itself what would his first words be we were not long left in doubt with a sigh the tension of his attitude relaxed and turning to japp he asked have you any idea my friend whether mr and mrs davenheim occupied the same bedroom the question seemed so ludicrously inappropriate that for a moment we both stared in silence then japp burst into a laugh good lord monsieur poirot i thought you were coming out with something startling as to your question im sure i dont know you could find out asked poirot with curious persistence oh certainlyif you really want to know merci mon ami i should be obliged if you would make a point of it japp stared at him a few minutes longer but poirot seemed to have forgotten us both the detective shook his head sadly at me and murmuring poor old fellow wars been too much for him gently withdrew from the room as poirot still seemed sunk in a daydream i took a sheet of paper and amused myself by scribbling notes upon it my friends voice aroused me he had come out of his reverie and was looking brisk and alert que faitesvous l mon ami i was jotting down what occurred to me as the main points of interest in this affair you become methodicalat last said poirot approvingly i concealed my pleasure shall i read them to you by all means i cleared my throat one all the evidence points to lowen having been the man who forced the safe two he had a grudge against davenheim three he lied in his first statement that he had never left the study four if you accept billy kelletts story as true lowen is unmistakably implicated i paused well i asked for i felt that i had put my finger on all the vital facts poirot looked at me pityingly shaking his head very gently mon pauvre ami but it is that you have not the gift the important detail you appreciate him never also your reasoning is false how let me take your four points one mr lowen could not possibly know that he would have the chance to open the safe he came for a business interview he could not know beforehand that mr davenheim would be absent posting a letter and that he would consequently be alone in the study he might have seized his opportunity i suggested and the tools city gentlemen do not carry round housebreakers tools on the off chance and one could not cut into that safe with a penknife bien entendu well what about number two you say lowen had a grudge against mr davenheim what you mean is that he had once or twice got the better of him and presumably those transactions were entered into with the view of benefiting himself in any case you do not as a rule bear a grudge against a man you have got the better ofit is more likely to be the other way about whatever grudge there might have been would have been on mr davenheims side well you cant deny that he lied about never having left the study no but he may have been frightened remember the missing mans clothes had just been discovered in the lake of course as usual he would have done better to speak the truth and the fourth point i grant you that if kelletts story is true lowen is undeniably implicated that is what makes the affair so very interesting then i did appreciate one vital fact perhapsbut you have entirely overlooked the two most important points the ones which undoubtedly hold the clue to the whole matter and pray what are they one the passion which has grown upon mr davenheim in the last few years for buying jewellery two his trip to buenos ayres last autumn poirot you are joking i am most serious ah sacred thunder but i hope japp will not forget my little commission but the detective entering into the spirit of the joke had remembered it so well that a telegram was handed to poirot about eleven oclock the next day at his request i opened it and read it out husband and wife have occupied separate rooms since last winter aha cried poirot and now we are in mid june all is solved i stared at him you have no moneys in the bank of davenheim and salmon mon ami no i said wondering why because i should advise you to withdraw itbefore it is too late why what do you expect i expect a big smash in a few daysperhaps sooner which reminds me we will return the compliment of a dpche to japp a pencil i pray you and a form voil advise you to withdraw any money deposited with firm in question that will intrigue him the good japp his eyes will open widewide he will not comprehend in the slightestuntil tomorrow or the next day i remained sceptical but the morrow forced me to render tribute to my friends remarkable powers in every paper was a huge headline telling of the sensational failure of the davenheim bank the disappearance of the famous financier took on a totally different aspect in the light of the revelation of the financial affairs of the bank before we were halfway through breakfast the door flew open and japp rushed in in his left hand was a paper in his right was poirots telegram which he banged down on the table in front of my friend how did you know monsieur poirot how the blazes could you know poirot smiled placidly at him ah mon ami after your wire it was a certainty from the commencement see you it struck me that the safe burglary was somewhat remarkable jewels ready money bearer bondsall so conveniently arranged forwhom well the good monsieur davenheim was of those who look after number one as your saying goes it seemed almost certain that it was arranged forhimself then his passion of late years for buying jewellery how simple the funds he embezzled he converted into jewels very likely replacing them in turn with paste duplicates and so he put away in a safe place under another name a considerable fortune to be enjoyed all in good time when every one has been thrown off the track his arrangements completed he makes an appointment with mr lowen who has been imprudent enough in the past to cross the great man once or twice drills a hole in the safe leaves orders that the guest is to be shown into the study and walks out of the housewhere poirot stopped and stretched out his hand for another boiled egg he frowned it is really insupportable he murmured that every hen lays an egg of a different size what symmetry can there be on the breakfast table at least they should sort them in dozens at the shop never mind the eggs said japp impatiently let em lay em square if they like tell us where our customer went to when he left the cedarsthat is if you know eh bien he went to his hidingplace ah this monsieur davenheim there may be some malformation in his grey cells but they are of the first quality do you know where he is hiding certainly it is most ingenious for the lords sake tell us then poirot gently collected every fragment of shell from his plate placed them in the eggcup and reversed the empty eggshell on top of them this little operation concluded he smiled on the neat effect and then beamed affectionately on us both come my friends you are men of intelligence ask yourselves the question which i asked myself if i were this man where should i hide hastings what do you say well i said im rather inclined to think id not do a bolt at all id stay in londonin the heart of things travel by tubes and buses ten to one id never be recognized theres safety in a crowd poirot turned inquiringly to japp i dont agree get clear away at oncethats the only chance i would have had plenty of time to prepare things beforehand id have a yacht waiting with steam up and id be off to one of the most outoftheway corners of the world before the hue and cry began we both looked at poirot what do you say monsieur for a moment he remained silent then a very curious smile flitted across his face my friends if i were hiding from the police do you know where i should hide in a prison what you are seeking monsieur davenheim in order to put him in prison so you never dream of looking to see if he may not be already there what do you mean you tell me madame davenheim is not a very intelligent woman nevertheless i think that if you took her to bow street and confronted her with the man billy kellett she would recognize him in spite of the fact that he has shaved his beard and moustache and those bushy eyebrows and has cropped his hair close a woman nearly always knows her husband though the rest of the world may be deceived billy kellett but hes known to the police did i not tell you davenheim was a clever man he prepared his alibi long beforehand he was not in buenos ayres last autumnhe was creating the character of billy kellett doing three months so that the police should have no suspicions when the time came he was playing remember for a large fortune as well as liberty it was worth while doing the thing thoroughly only yes eh bien afterwards he had to wear a false beard and wig had to make up as himself again and to sleep with a false beard is not easyit invites detection he cannot risk continuing to share the chamber of madame his wife you found out for me that for the last six months or ever since his supposed return from buenos ayres he and mrs davenheim occupied separate rooms then i was sure everything fitted in the gardener who fancied he saw his master going round to the side of the house was quite right he went to the boathouse donned his tramp clothes which you may be sure had been safely hidden from the eyes of his valet dropped the others in the lake and proceeded to carry out his plan by pawning the ring in an obvious manner and then assaulting a policeman getting himself safely into the haven of bow street where nobody would ever dream of looking for him its impossible murmured japp ask madame said my friend smiling the next day a registered letter lay beside poirots plate he opened it and a fivepound note fluttered out my friends brow puckered ah sacr but what shall i do with it i have much remorse ce pauvre japp ah an idea we will have a little dinner we three that consoles me it was really too easy i am ashamed i who would not rob a childmille tonnerres mon ami what have you that you laugh so heartily   x   the adventure of the italian nobleman poirot and i had many friends and acquaintances of an informal nature amongst these was to be numbered dr hawker a near neighbour of ours and a member of the medical profession it was the genial doctors habit to drop in sometimes of an evening and have a chat with poirot of whose genius he was an ardent admirer the doctor himself frank and unsuspicious to the last degree admired the talents so far removed from his own on one particular evening in early june he arrived about halfpast eight and settled down to a comfortable discussion on the cheery topic of the prevalence of arsenical poisoning in crimes it must have been about a quarter of an hour later when the door of our sittingroom flew open and a distracted female precipitated herself into the room oh doctor youre wanted such a terrible voice it gave me a turn it did indeed i recognized in our new visitor dr hawkers housekeeper miss rider the doctor was a bachelor and lived in a gloomy old house a few streets away the usually placid miss rider was now in a state bordering on incoherence what terrible voice who is it and whats the trouble it was the telephone doctor i answered itand a voice spoke help it said doctorhelp theyve killed me then it sort of tailed away whos speaking i said whos speaking then i got a reply just a whisper it seemed foscatinesomething like thatregents court the doctor uttered an exclamation count foscatini he has a flat in regents court i must go at once what can have happened a patient of yours asked poirot i attended him for some slight ailment a few weeks ago an italian but he speaks english perfectly well i must wish you good night monsieur poirot unless he hesitated i perceive the thought in your mind said poirot smiling i shall be delighted to accompany you hastings run down and get hold of a taxi taxis always make themselves sought for when one is particularly pressed for time but i captured one at last and we were soon bowling along in the direction of regents park regents court was a new block of flats situated just off st johns wood road they had only recently been built and contained the latest service devices there was no one in the hall the doctor pressed the liftbell impatiently and when the lift arrived questioned the uniformed attendant sharply flat ii count foscatini theres been an accident there i understand the man stared at him first ive heard of it mr gravesthats count foscatinis manwent out about half an hour ago and he said nothing is the count alone in the flat no sir hes got two gentlemen dining with him what are they like i asked eagerly we were in the lift now ascending rapidly to the second floor on which flat ii was situated i didnt see them myself sir but i understand that they were foreign gentlemen he pulled back the iron door and we stepped out on the landing no ii was opposite to us the doctor rang the bell there was no reply and we could hear no sound from within the doctor rang again and again we could hear the bell trilling within but no sign of life rewarded us this is getting serious muttered the doctor he turned to the lift attendant is there any passkey to this door there is one in the porters office downstairs get it then and look here i think youd better send for the police poirot approved with a nod of the head the man returned shortly with him came the manager will you tell me gentlemen what is the meaning of all this certainly i received a telephone message from count foscatini stating that he had been attacked and was dying you can understand that we must lose no timeif we are not already too late the manager produced the key without more ado and we all entered the flat we passed first into a small square lounge hall a door on the right of it was half open the manager indicated it with a nod the diningroom dr hawker led the way we followed close on his heels as we entered the room i gave a gasp the round table in the centre bore the remains of a meal three chairs were pushed back as though their occupants had just risen in the corner to the right of the fireplace was a big writingtable and sitting at it was a manor what had been a man his right hand still grasped the base of the telephone but he had fallen forward struck down by a terrific blow on the head from behind the weapon was not far to seek a marble statuette stood where it had been hurriedly put down the base of it stained with blood the doctors examination did not take a minute stone dead must have been almost instantaneous i wonder he even managed to telephone it will be better not to move him until the police arrive on the managers suggestion we searched the flat but the result was a foregone conclusion it was not likely that the murderers would be concealed there when all they had to do was to walk out we came back to the diningroom poirot had not accompanied us in our tour i found him studying the centre table with close attention i joined him it was a wellpolished round mahogany table a bowl of roses decorated the centre and white lace mats reposed on the gleaming surface there was a dish of fruit but the three dessert plates were untouched there were three coffeecups with remains of coffee in themtwo black one with milk all three men had taken port and the decanter halffull stood before the centre plate one of the men had smoked a cigar the other two cigarettes a tortoiseshellandsilver box holding cigars and cigarettes stood open upon the table i enumerated all these facts to myself but i was forced to admit that they did not shed any brilliant light on the situation i wondered what poirot saw in them to make him so intent i asked him mon ami he replied you miss the point i am looking for something that i do not see what is that a mistakeeven a little mistakeon the part of the murderer he stepped swiftly to the small adjoining kitchen looked in and shook his head monsieur he said to the manager explain to me i pray your system of serving meals here the manager stepped to a small hatch in the wall this is the service lift he explained it runs to the kitchens at the top of the building you order through this telephone and the dishes are sent down in the lift one course at a time the dirty plates and dishes are sent up in the same manner no domestic worries you understand and at the same time you avoid the wearying publicity of always dining in a restaurant poirot nodded then the plates and dishes that were used tonight are on high in the kitchen you permit that i mount there oh certainly if you like roberts the lift man will take you up and introduce you but im afraid you wont find anything thats of any use theyre handling hundreds of plates and dishes and theyll be all lumped together poirot remained firm however and together we visited the kitchens and questioned the man who had taken the order from flat ii the order was given from the  la carte menufor three he explained soup julienne filet de sole normande tournedos of beef and a rice souffl what time just about eight oclock i should say no im afraid the plates and dishes have been all washed up by now unfortunate you were thinking of fingerprints i suppose not exactly said poirot with an enigmatical smile i am more interested in count foscatinis appetite did he partake of every dish yes but of course i cant say how much of each he ate the plates were all soiled and the dishes emptythat is to say with the exception of the rice souffl there was a fair amount of that left ah said poirot and seemed satisfied with the fact as we descended to the flat again he remarked in a low tone we have decidedly to do with a man of method do you mean the murderer or count foscatini the latter was undoubtedly an orderly gentleman after imploring help and announcing his approaching demise he carefully hung up the telephone receiver i stared at poirot his words now and his recent inquiries gave me the glimmering of an idea you suspect poison i breathed the blow on the head was a blind poirot merely smiled we reentered the flat to find the local inspector of police had arrived with two constables he was inclined to resent our appearance but poirot calmed him with the mention of our scotland yard friend inspector japp and we were accorded a grudging permission to remain it was a lucky thing we were for we had not been back five minutes before an agitated middleaged man came rushing into the room with every appearance of grief and agitation this was graves valetbutler to the late count foscatini the story he had to tell was a sensational one on the previous morning two gentlemen had called to see his master they were italians and the elder of the two a man of about forty gave his name as signor ascanio the younger was a welldressed lad of about twentyfour count foscatini was evidently prepared for their visit and immediately sent graves out upon some trivial errand here the man paused and hesitated in his story in the end however he admitted that curious as to the purport of the interview he had not obeyed immediately but had lingered about endeavouring to hear something of what was going on the conversation was carried on in so low a tone that he was not as successful as he had hoped but he gathered enough to make it clear that some kind of monetary proposition was being discussed and that the basis of it was a threat the discussion was anything but amicable in the end count foscatini raised his voice slightly and the listener heard these words clearly i have no time to argue further now gentlemen if you will dine with me tomorrow night at eight oclock we will resume the discussion afraid of being discovered listening graves had then hurried out to do his masters errand this evening the two men had arrived punctually at eight during dinner they had talked of indifferent matterspolitics the weather and the theatrical world when graves had placed the port upon the table and brought in the coffee his master told him that he might have the evening off was that a usual proceeding of his when he had guests asked the inspector no sir it wasnt thats what made me think it must be some business of a very unusual kind that he was going to discuss with these gentlemen that finished gravess story he had gone out about  and meeting a friend had accompanied him to the metropolitan music hall in edgware road nobody had seen the two men leave but the time of the murder was fixed clearly enough at  a small clock on the writingtable had been swept off by foscatinis arm and had stopped at that hour which agreed with miss riders telephone summons the police surgeon had made his examination of the body and it was now lying on the couch i saw the face for the first timethe olive complexion the long nose the luxuriant black moustache and the full red lips drawn back from the dazzlingly white teeth not altogether a pleasant face well said the inspector refastening his notebook the case seems clear enough the only difficulty will be to lay our hands on this signor ascanio i suppose his address is not in the dead mans pocketbook by any chance as poirot had said the late foscatini was an orderly man neatly written in small precise handwriting was the inscription signor paolo ascanio grosvenor hotel the inspector busied himself with the telephone then turned to us with a grin just in time our fine gentleman was off to catch the boat train to the continong well gentlemen thats about all we can do here its a bad business but straightforward enough one of these italian vendetta things as likely as not thus airily dismissed we found our way downstairs dr hawker was full of excitement like the beginning of a novel eh real exciting stuff wouldnt believe it if you read about it poirot did not speak he was very thoughtful all the evening he had hardly opened his lips what says the master detective eh asked hawker clapping him on the back nothing to work your grey cells over this time you think not what could there be well for example there is the window the window but it was fastened nobody could have got out or in that way i noticed it specially and why were you able to notice it the doctor looked puzzled poirot hastened to explain it is to the curtains i refer they were not drawn a little odd that and then there was the coffee it was very black coffee well what of it very black repeated poirot in conjunction with that let us remember that very little of the rice souffl was eaten and we getwhat moonshine laughed the doctor youre pulling my leg never do i pull the leg hastings here knows that i am perfectly serious i dont know what you are getting at all the same i confessed you dont suspect the manservant do you he might have been in with the gang and put some dope in the coffee i suppose theyll test his alibi without doubt my friend but it is the alibi of signor ascanio that interests me you think he has an alibi that is just what worries me i have no doubt that we shall soon be enlightened on that point the daily newsmonger enabled us to become conversant with succeeding events signor ascanio was arrested and charged with the murder of count foscatini when arrested he denied knowing the count and declared he had never been near regents court either on the evening of the crime or on the previous morning the younger man had disappeared entirely signor ascanio had arrived alone at the grosvenor hotel from the continent two days before the murder all efforts to trace the second man failed ascanio however was not sent for trial no less a personage than the italian ambassador himself came forward and testified at the policecourt proceedings that ascanio had been with him at the embassy from eight till nine that evening the prisoner was discharged naturally a lot of people thought that the crime was a political one and was being deliberately hushed up poirot had taken a keen interest in all these points nevertheless i was somewhat surprised when he suddenly informed me one morning that he was expecting a visitor at eleven oclock and that that visitor was none other than ascanio himself he wishes to consult you du tout hastings i wish to consult him what about the regents court murder you are going to prove that he did it a man cannot be tried twice for murder hastings endeavour to have the common sense ah that is our friends ring a few minutes later signor ascanio was ushered ina small thin man with a secretive and furtive glance in his eyes he remained standing darting suspicious glances from one to the other of us monsieur poirot my little friend tapped himself gently on the chest be seated signor you received my note i am determined to get to the bottom of this mystery in some small measure you can aid me let us commence youin company with a friendvisited the late count foscatini on the morning of tuesday the th the italian made an angry gesture i did nothing of the sort i have sworn in court prcismentand i have a little idea that you have sworn falsely you threaten me bah i have nothing to fear from you i have been acquitted exactly and as i am not an imbecile it is not with the gallows i threaten youbut with publicity publicity i see that you do not like the word i had an idea that you would not my little ideas you know they are very valuable to me come signor your only chance is to be frank with me i do not ask to know whose indiscretions brought you to england i know this much you came for the especial purpose of seeing count foscatini he was not a count growled the italian i have already noted the fact that his name does not appear in the almanach de gotha never mind the title of count is often useful in the profession of blackmailing i suppose i might as well be frank you seem to know a good deal i have employed my grey cells to some advantage come signor ascanio you visited the dead man on the tuesday morningthat is so is it not yes but i never went there on the following evening there was no need i will tell you all certain information concerning a man of great position in italy had come into this scoundrels possession he demanded a big sum of money in return for the papers i came over to england to arrange the matter i called upon him by appointment that morning one of the young secretaries of the embassy was with me the count was more reasonable than i had hoped although even then the sum of money i paid him was a huge one pardon how was it paid in italian notes of comparatively small denomination i paid over the money then and there he handed me the incriminating papers i never saw him again why did you not say all this when you were arrested in my delicate position i was forced to deny any association with the man and how do you account for the events of the evening then i can only think that some one must have deliberately impersonated me i understand that no money was found in the flat poirot looked at him and shook his head strange he murmured we all have the little grey cells and so few of us know how to use them good morning signor ascanio i believe your story it is very much as i had imagined but i had to make sure after bowing his guest out poirot returned to his armchair and smiled at me let us hear m le capitaine hastings on the case well i suppose ascanio is rightsomebody impersonated him never never will you use the brains the good god has given you recall to yourself some words i uttered after leaving the flat that night i referred to the windowcurtains not being drawn we are in the month of june it is still light at eight oclock the light is failing by halfpast a vous dit quelque chose i perceive a struggling impression that you will arrive some day now let us continue the coffee was as i said very black count foscatinis teeth were magnificently white coffee stains the teeth we reason from that that count foscatini did not drink any coffee yet there was coffee in all three cups why should anyone pretend count foscatini had drunk coffee when he had not done so i shook my head utterly bewildered come i will help you what evidence have we that ascanio and his friend or two men posing as them ever came to the flat that night nobody saw them go in nobody saw them go out we have the evidence of one man and of a host of inanimate objects you mean i mean knives and forks and plates and empty dishes ah but it was a clever idea graves is a thief and a scoundrel but what a man of method he overhears a portion of the conversation in the morning enough to realize that ascanio will be in awkward position to defend himself the following evening about eight oclock he tells his master he is wanted at the telephone foscatini sits down stretches out his hand to the telephone and from behind graves strikes him down with the marble figure then quickly to the service telephonedinner for three it comes he lays the table dirties the plates knives and forks etc but he has to get rid of the food too not only is he a man of brain he has a resolute and capacious stomach but after eating three tournedos the rice souffl is too much for him he even smokes a cigar and two cigarettes to carry out the illusion ah but it was magnificently thorough then having moved on the hands of the clock to  he smashes it and stops it the one thing he does not do is to draw the curtains but if there had been a real dinner party the curtains would have been drawn as soon as the light began to fail then he hurries out mentioning the guests to the lift man in passing he hurries to a telephone box and as near as possible to  rings up the doctor with his masters dying cry so successful is his idea that no one ever inquires if a call was put through from flat ii at that time except hercule poirot i suppose i said sarcastically not even hercule poirot said my friend with a smile i am about to inquire now i had to prove my point to you first but you will see i shall be right and then japp to whom i have already given a hint will be able to arrest the respectable graves i wonder how much of the money he has spent poirot was right he always is confound him   xi   the case of the missing will the problem presented to us by miss violet marsh made rather a pleasant change from our usual routine work poirot had received a brisk and businesslike note from the lady asking for an appointment and he had replied asking her to call upon him at eleven oclock the following day she arrived punctuallya tall handsome young woman plainly but neatly dressed with an assured and businesslike manner clearly a young woman who meant to get on in the world i am not a great admirer of the socalled new woman myself and in spite of her good looks i was not particularly prepossessed in her favour my business is of a somewhat unusual nature monsieur poirot she began after she had accepted a chair i had better begin at the beginning and tell you the whole story if you please mademoiselle i am an orphan my father was one of two brothers sons of a small yeoman farmer in devonshire the farm was a poor one and the elder brother andrew emigrated to australia where he did very well indeed and by means of successful speculation in land became a very rich man the younger brother roger my father had no leanings towards the agricultural life he managed to educate himself a little and obtained a post as a clerk with a small firm he married slightly above him my mother was the daughter of a poor artist my father died when i was six years old when i was fourteen my mother followed him to the grave my only living relation then was my uncle andrew who had recently returned from australia and bought a small place crabtree manor in his native county he was exceedingly kind to his brothers orphan child took me to live with him and treated me in every way as though i was his own daughter crabtree manor in spite of its name is really only an old farmhouse farming was in my uncles blood and he was intensely interested in various modern farming experiments although kindness itself to me he had certain peculiar and deeplyrooted ideas as to the upbringing of women himself a man of little or no education though possessing remarkable shrewdness he placed little value on what he called book knowledge he was especially opposed to the education of women in his opinion girls should learn practical housework and dairywork be useful about the home and have as little to do with book learning as possible he proposed to bring me up on these lines to my bitter disappointment and annoyance i rebelled frankly i knew that i possessed a good brain and had absolutely no talent for domestic duties my uncle and i had many bitter arguments on the subject for though much attached to each other we were both selfwilled i was lucky enough to win a scholarship and up to a certain point was successful in getting my own way the crisis arose when i resolved to go to girton i had a little money of my own left me by my mother and i was quite determined to make the best use of the gifts god had given me i had one long final argument with my uncle he put the facts plainly before me he had no other relations and he had intended me to be his sole heiress as i have told you he was a very rich man if i persisted in these newfangled notions of mine however i need look for nothing from him i remained polite but firm i should always be deeply attached to him i told him but i must lead my own life we parted on that note you fancy your brains my girl were his last words ive no book learning but for all that ill pit mine against yours any day well see what we shall see that was nine years ago i have stayed with him for a weekend occasionally and our relations were perfectly amicable though his views remained unaltered he never referred to my having matriculated nor to my bsc for the last three years his health had been failing and a month ago he died i am now coming to the point of my visit my uncle left a most extraordinary will by its terms crabtree manor and its contents are to be at my disposal for a year from his deathduring which time my clever niece may prove her wits the actual words run at the end of that period my wits having proved better than hers the house and all my uncles large fortune pass to various charitable institutions that is a little hard on you mademoiselle seeing that you were mr marshs only blood relation i do not look on it in that way uncle andrew warned me fairly and i chose my own path since i would not fall in with his wishes he was at perfect liberty to leave his money to whom he pleased was the will drawn up by a lawyer no it was written on a printed willform and witnessed by the man and his wife who live in the house and do for my uncle there might be a possibility of upsetting such a will i would not even attempt to do such a thing you regard it then as a sporting challenge on the part of your uncle that is exactly how i look upon it it bears that interpretation certainly said poirot thoughtfully somewhere in this rambling old manorhouse your uncle has concealed either a sum of money in notes or possibly a second will and has given you a year in which to exercise your ingenuity to find it exactly monsieur poirot and i am paying you the compliment of assuming that your ingenuity will be greater than mine eh eh but that is very charming of you my grey cells are at your disposal you have made no search yourself only a cursory one but i have too much respect for my uncles undoubted abilities to fancy that the task will be an easy one have you the will or a copy of it with you miss marsh handed a document across the table poirot ran through it nodding to himself made three years ago dated march  and the time is given also amthat is very suggestive it narrows the field of search assuredly it is another will we have to seek for a will made even halfanhour later would upset this eh bien mademoiselle it is a problem charming and ingenious that you have presented to me here i shall have all the pleasure in the world in solving it for you granted that your uncle was a man of ability his grey cells cannot have been of the quality of hercule poirots really poirots vanity is blatant fortunately i have nothing of moment on hand at the minute hastings and i will go down to crabtree manor tonight the man and wife who attended on your uncle are still there i presume yes their name is baker                      the following morning saw us started on the hunt proper we had arrived late the night before mr and mrs baker having received a telegram from miss marsh were expecting us they were a pleasant couple the man gnarled and pinkcheeked like a shrivelled pippin and his wife a woman of vast proportions and true devonshire calm tired with our journey and the eightmile drive from the station we had retired at once to bed after a supper of roast chicken apple pie and devonshire cream we had now disposed of an excellent breakfast and were sitting in a small panelled room which had been the late mr marshs study and livingroom a rolltop desk stuffed with papers all neatly docketed stood against the wall and a big leather armchair showed plainly that it had been its owners constant restingplace a big chintzcovered settee ran along the opposite wall and the deep low window seats were covered with the same faded chintz of an oldfashioned pattern eh bien mon ami said poirot lighting one of his tiny cigarettes we must map out our plan of campaign already i have made a rough survey of the house but i am of opinion that any clue will be found in this room we shall have to go through the documents in the desk with meticulous care naturally i do not expect to find the will amongst them but it is likely that some apparently innocent paper may conceal the clue to its hidingplace but first we must have a little information ring the bell i pray of you i did so while we were waiting for it to be answered poirot walked up and down looking about him approvingly a man of method this mr marsh see how neatly the packets of papers are docketed then the key to each drawer has its ivory labelso has the key of the china cabinet on the wall and see with what precision the china within is arranged it rejoices the heart nothing here offends the eye he came to an abrupt pause as his eye was caught by the key of the desk itself to which a dirty envelope was affixed poirot frowned at it and withdrew it from the lock on it were scrawled the words key of roll top desk in a crabbed handwriting quite unlike the neat superscriptions on the other keys an alien note said poirot frowning i could swear that here we have no longer the personality of mr marsh but who else has been in the house only miss marsh and she if i mistake not is also a young lady of method and order baker came in answer to the bell will you fetch madame your wife and answer a few questions baker departed and in a few moments returned with mrs baker wiping her hands on her apron and beaming all over her face in a few clear words poirot set forth the object of his mission the bakers were immediately sympathetic us dont want to see miss violet done out of whats hers declared the woman cruel hard twould be for hospitals to get it all poirot proceeded with his questions yes mr and mrs baker remembered perfectly witnessing the will baker had previously been sent into the neighbouring town to get two printed willforms two said poirot sharply yes sir for safety like i suppose in case he should spoil oneand sure enough so he did do us had signed one what time of day was that baker scratched his head but his wife was quicker why to be sure id just put the milk on for the cocoa at eleven dont ee remember it had all boiled over on the stove when us got back to kitchen and afterwards twould be about an hour later us had to go in again ive made a mistake says old master had to tear the whole thing up ill trouble you to sign again and us did and afterwards master give us a tidy sum of money each ive left you nothing in my will says he but each year i live youll have this to be a nestegg when im gone and sure enough so he did poirot reflected after you had signed the second time what did mr marsh do do you know went out to the village to pay tradesmens books that did not seem very promising poirot tried another tack he held out the key of the desk is that your masters writing i may have imagined it but i fancied that a moment or two elapsed before baker replied yes sir it is hes lying i thought but why has your master let the househave there been any strangers in it during the last three years no sir no visitors only miss violet no strangers of any kind been inside this room no sir you forget the workmen jim his wife reminded him workmen poirot wheeled round on her what workmen the woman explained that about two years and a half ago workmen had been in the house to do certain repairs she was quite vague as to what the repairs were her view seemed to be that the whole thing was a fad of her masters and quite unnecessary part of the time the workmen had been in the study but what they had done there she could not say as her master had not let either of them into the room whilst the work was in progress unfortunately they could not remember the name of the firm employed beyond the fact that it was a plymouth one we progress hastings said poirot rubbing his hands as the bakers left the room clearly he made a second will and then had workmen from plymouth in to make a suitable hidingplace instead of wasting time taking up the floor and tapping the walls we will go to plymouth with a little trouble we were able to get the information we wanted after one or two essays we found the firm employed by mr marsh their employees had all been with them many years and it was easy to find the two men who had worked under mr marshs orders they remembered the job perfectly amongst various other minor jobs they had taken up one of the bricks of the oldfashioned fireplace made a cavity beneath and so cut the brick that it was impossible to see the join by pressing on the second brick from the end the whole thing was raised it had been quite a complicated piece of work and the old gentleman had been very fussy about it our informant was a man called coghan a big gaunt man with a grizzled moustache he seemed an intelligent fellow we returned to crabtree manor in high spirits and locking the study door proceeded to put our newly acquired knowledge into effect it was impossible to see any sign on the bricks but when we pressed in the manner indicated a deep cavity was at once disclosed eagerly poirot plunged in his hand suddenly his face fell from complacent elation to consternation all he held was a charred fragment of stiff paper but for it the cavity was empty sacr cried poirot angrily some one has been before us we examined the scrap of paper anxiously clearly it was a fragment of what we sought a portion of bakers signature remained but no indication of what the terms of the will had been poirot sat back on his heels his expression would have been comical if we had not been so overcome i understand it not he growled who destroyed this and what was their object the bakers i suggested pourquoi neither will makes any provision for them and they are more likely to be kept on with miss marsh than if the place became the property of a hospital how could it be to anyones advantage to destroy the will the hospitals benefityes but one cannot suspect institutions perhaps the old man changed his mind and destroyed it himself i suggested poirot rose to his feet dusting his knees with his usual care that may be he admitted one of your more sensible observations hastings well we can do no more here we have done all that mortal man can do we have successfully pitted our wits against the late andrew marshs but unfortunately his niece is no better off for our success by driving to the station at once we were just able to catch a train to london though not the principal express poirot was sad and dissatisfied for my part i was tired and dozed in a corner suddenly as we were just moving out of taunton poirot uttered a piercing squeal vite hastings awake and jump but jump i say before i knew where i was we were standing on the platform bareheaded and minus our valises whilst the train disappeared into the night i was furious but poirot paid no attention imbecile that i have been he cried triple imbecile not again will i vaunt my little grey cells thats a good job at any rate i said grumpily but what is this all about as usual when following out his own ideas poirot paid absolutely no attention to me the tradesmens booksi have left them entirely out of account yes but where where never mind i cannot be mistaken we must return at once easier said than done we managed to get a slow train to exeter and there poirot hired a car we arrived back at crabtree manor in the small hours of the morning i pass over the bewilderment of the bakers when we had at last aroused them paying no attention to anybody poirot strode at once to the study i have been not a triple imbecile but thirtysix times one my friend he deigned to remark now behold going straight to the desk he drew out the key and detached the envelope from it i stared at him stupidly how could he possibly hope to find a big willform in that tiny envelope with great care he cut open the envelope laying it out flat then he lighted the fire and held the plain inside surface of the envelope to the flame in a few minutes faint characters began to appear look mon ami cried poirot in triumph i looked there were just a few lines of faint writing stating briefly that he left everything to his niece violet marsh it was dated march   pm and witnessed by albert pike confectioner and jessie pike married woman but is it legal i gasped as far as i know there is no law against writing your will in a blend of disappearing and sympathetic ink the intention of the testator is clear and the beneficiary is his only living relation but the cleverness of him he foresaw every step that a searcher would takethat i miserable imbecile took he gets two willforms makes the servants sign twice then sallies out with his will written on the inside of a dirty envelope and a fountainpen containing his little ink mixture on some excuse he gets the confectioner and his wife to sign their names under his own signature then he ties it to the key of his desk and chuckles to himself if his niece sees through his little ruse she will have justified her choice of life and elaborate education and be thoroughly welcome to his money she didnt see through it did she i said slowly it seems rather unfair the old man really won but no hastings it is your wits that go astray miss marsh proved the astuteness of her wits and the value of the higher education for women by at once putting the matter in my hands always employ the expert she has amply proved her right to the money i wonderi very much wonderwhat old andrew marsh would have thought   the end end of the project gutenberg ebook

investigates i the adventure of the western star i was standing at the window of poirots rooms looking out idly on the street below . thats queer i ejaculated suddenly beneath my breath . what is mon ami ? asked poirot placidly from the depths of his comfortable chair . deduce poirot from the following facts here is a young lady richly dressedfashionable hat magnificent furs . she is coming along slowly looking up at the houses as she goes . unknown to her she is being shadowed by three men and a middleaged woman . they have just been joined by an errand boy who points after the girl gesticulating as he does so . what drama is this being played ? is the girl a crook and are the shadowers detectives preparing to arrest her ? or are they the scoundrels and are they plotting to attack an innocent victim ? what does the great detective say ? the great detective mon ami chooses as ever the simplest course . he rises to see for himself . and my friend joined me at the window . in a minute he gave vent to an amused chuckle . as usual your facts are tinged with your incurable romanticism . that is miss mary marvell the film star . she is being followed by a bevy of admirers who have recognized her . and en passant my dear hastings she is quite aware of the fact i laughed . so all is explained but you get no marks for that poirot . it was a mere matter of recognition . en vrit and how many times have you seen mary marvell on the screen mon cher ? i thought . about a dozen times perhaps . and ionce yet i recognize her and you do not . she looks so different i replied rather feebly . ah sacr cried poirot . is it that you expect her to promenade herself in the streets of london in a cowboy hat or with bare feet and a bunch of curls as an irish colleen ? always with you it is the nonessentials remember the case of the dancer valerie saintclair . i shrugged my shoulders slightly annoyed . but console yourself mon ami said poirot calming down . all cannot be as hercule poirot i know it well . you really have the best opinion of yourself of anyone i ever knew i cried divided between amusement and annoyance . what will you ? when one is unique one knows it and others share that opinioneven if i mistake not miss mary marvell . what ? without doubt . she is coming here . how do you make that out ? very simply . this street it is not aristocratic mon ami in it there is no fashionable doctor no fashionable dentiststill less is there a fashionable milliner but there is a fashionable detective . oui my friend it is truei am become the mode the dernier cri one says to another comment ? you have lost your gold pencilcase ? you must go to the little belgian . he is too marvellous every one goes courez and they arrive in flocks mon ami with problems of the most foolish a bell rang below . what did i tell you ? that is miss marvell . as usual poirot was right . after a short interval the american film star was ushered in and we rose to our feet . mary marvell was undoubtedly one of the most popular actresses on the screen . she had only lately arrived in england in company with her husband gregory b . rolf also a film actor . their marriage had taken place about a year ago in the states and this was their first visit to england . they had been given a great reception . every one was prepared to go mad over mary marvell her wonderful clothes her furs her jewels above all one jewel the great diamond which had been nicknamed to match its owner the western star . much true and untrue had been written about this famous stone which was reported to be insured for the enormous sum of fifty thousand pounds . all these details passed rapidly through my mind as i joined with poirot in greeting our fair client . miss marvell was small and slender very fair and girlishlooking with the wide innocent blue eyes of a child . poirot drew forward a chair for her and she commenced talking at once . you will probably think me very foolish monsieur poirot but lord cronshaw was telling me last night how wonderfully you cleared up the mystery of his nephews death and i felt that i just must have your advice . i dare say its only a silly hoaxgregory says sobut its just worrying me to death . she paused for breath . poirot beamed encouragement . proceed madame . you comprehend i am still in the dark . its these letters . miss marvell unclasped her handbag and drew out three envelopes which she handed to poirot . the latter scrutinized them closely . cheap paperthe name and address carefully printed . let us see the inside . he drew out the enclosure . i had joined him and was leaning over his shoulder . the writing consisted of a single sentence carefully printed like the envelope . it ran as follows the great diamond which is the left eye of the god must return whence it came . the second letter was couched in precisely the same terms but the third was more explicit you have been warned . you have not obeyed . now the diamond will be taken from you . at the full of the moon the two diamonds which are the left and right eye of the god shall return . so it is written . the first letter i treated as a joke explained miss marvell . when i got the second i began to wonder . the third one came yesterday and it seemed to me that after all the matter might be more serious than i had imagined . i see they did not come by post these letters . no they were left by handby a chinaman . that is what frightens me . why ? because it was from a chink in san francisco that gregory bought the stone three years ago . i see madame that you believe the diamond referred to to be the western star finished miss marvell . thats so . at the time gregory remembers that there was some story attached to the stone but the chink wasnt handing out any information . gregory says he seemed just scared to death and in a mortal hurry to get rid of the thing . he only asked about a tenth of its value . it was gregs wedding present to me . poirot nodded thoughtfully . the story seems of an almost unbelievable romanticism . and yetwho knows ? i pray of you hastings hand me my little almanac . i complied . voyons said poirot turning the leaves . when is the date of the full moon ? ah friday next . that is in three days time . eh bien madame you seek my advicei give it to you . this belle histoire may be a hoaxbut it may not therefore i counsel you to place the diamond in my keeping until after friday next . then we can take what steps we please . a slight cloud passed over the actresss face and she replied constrainedly im afraid thats impossible . you have it with youhein ? poirot was watching her narrowly . the girl hesitated a moment then slipped her hand into the bosom of her gown drawing out a long thin chain . she leaned forward unclosing her hand . in the palm a stone of white fire exquisitely set in platinum lay and winked at us solemnly . poirot drew in his breath with a long hiss . patant he murmured . you permit madame ? he took the jewel in his own hand and scrutinized it keenly then restored it to her with a little bow . a magnificent stonewithout a flaw . ah cent tonnerres and you carry it about with you comme a no no im very careful really monsieur poirot . as a rule its locked up in my jewelcase and left in the hotel safe deposit . were staying at the magnificent you know . i just brought it along today for you to see . and you will leave it with me nestce pas ? you will be advised by papa poirot ? well you see its this way monsieur poirot . on friday were going down to yardly chase to spend a few days with lord and lady yardly . her words awoke a vague echo of remembrance in my mind . some gossipwhat was it now ? a few years ago lord and lady yardly had paid a visit to the states rumour had it that his lordship had rather gone the pace out there with the assistance of some lady friendsbut surely there was something more some gossip which coupled lady yardlys name with that of a movie star in californiawhy it came to me in a flashof course it was none other than gregory b . rolf . ill let you into a little secret monsieur poirot miss marvell was continuing . weve got a deal on with lord yardly . theres some chance of our arranging to film a play down there in his ancestral pile . at yardly chase ? i cried interested . why its one of the show places of england . miss marvell nodded . i guess its the real old feudal stuff all right . but he wants a pretty stiff price and of course i dont know yet whether the deal will go through but greg and i always like to combine business with pleasure . buti demand pardon if i am dense madamesurely it is possible to visit yardly chase without taking the diamond with you ? a shrewd hard look came into miss marvells eyes which belied their childlike appearance . she looked suddenly a good deal older . i want to wear it down there . surely i said suddenly there are some very famous jewels in the yardly collection a large diamond amongst them ? thats so said miss marvell briefly . i heard poirot murmur beneath his breath ah cest comme a then he said aloud with his usual uncanny luck in hitting the bullseye he dignifies it by the name of psychology then you are without doubt already acquainted with lady yardly or perhaps your husband is ? gregory knew her when she was out west three years ago said miss marvell . she hesitated a moment and then added abruptly do either of you ever see society gossip ? we both pleaded guilty rather shamefacedly . i ask because in this weeks number there is an article on famous jewels and its really very curious she broke off . i rose went to the table at the other side of the room and returned with the paper in question in my hand . she took it from me found the article and began to read aloud  .  .  . amongst other famous stones may be included the star of the east a diamond in the possession of the yardly family . an ancestor of the present lord yardly brought it back with him from china and a romantic story is said to attach to it . according to this the stone was once the right eye of a temple god . another diamond exactly similar in form and size formed the left eye and the story goes that this jewel too would in course of time be stolen . one eye shall go west the other east till they shall meet once more . then in triumph shall they return to the god . it is a curious coincidence that there is at the present time a stone corresponding closely in description with this one and known as the star of the west or the western star . it is the property of the celebrated film actress miss mary marvell . a comparison of the two stones would be interesting . she stopped . patant murmured poirot . without doubt a romance of the first water . he turned to mary marvell . and you are not afraid madame ? you have no superstitious terrors ? you do not fear to introduce these two siamese twins to each other lest a chinaman should appear and hey presto whisk them both back to china ? his tone was mocking but i fancied that an undercurrent of seriousness lay beneath it . i dont believe that lady yardlys diamond is anything like as good a stone as mine said miss marvell . anyway im going to see . what more poirot would have said i do not know for at that moment the door flew open and a splendidlooking man strode into the room . from his crisply curling black head to the tips of his patentleather boots he was a hero fit for romance . i said id call round for you mary said gregory rolf and here i am . well what does monsieur poirot say to our little problem ? just one big hoax same as i do ? poirot smiled up at the big actor . they made a ridiculous contrast . hoax or no hoax mr . rolf he said dryly i have advised madame your wife not to take the jewel with her to yardly chase on friday . im with you there sir . ive already said so to mary . but there shes a woman through and through and i guess she cant bear to think of another woman outshining her in the jewel line . what nonsense gregory said mary marvell sharply . but she flushed angrily . poirot shrugged his shoulders . madame i have advised . i can do no more . cest fini . he bowed them both to the door . ah la la he observed returning . histoire de femmes the good husband he hit the nail on the headtout de mme he was not tactful assuredly not . i imparted to him my vague remembrances and he nodded vigorously . so i thought . all the same there is something curious underneath all this . with your permission mon ami i will take the air . await my return i beg of you . i shall not be long . i was half asleep in my chair when the landlady tapped on the door and put her head in . its another lady to see mr . poirot sir . ive told her he was out but she says as how shell wait seeing as shes come up from the country . oh show her in here mrs . murchison . perhaps i can do something for her . in another moment the lady had been ushered in . my heart gave a leap as i recognized her . lady yardlys portrait had figured too often in the society papers to allow her to remain unknown . do sit down lady yardly i said drawing forward a chair . my friend poirot is out but i know for a fact that hell be back very shortly . she thanked me and sat down . a very different type this from miss mary marvell . tall dark with flashing eyes and a pale proud faceyet something wistful in the curves of the mouth . i felt a desire to rise to the occasion . why not ? in poirots presence i have frequently felt a difficultyi do not appear at my best . and yet there is no doubt that i too possess the deductive sense in a marked degree . i leant forward on a sudden impulse . lady yardly i said i know why you have come here . you have received blackmailing letters about the diamond . there was no doubt as to my bolt having shot home . she stared at me openmouthed all colour banished from her cheeks . you know ? she gasped . how ? i smiled . by a perfectly logical process . if miss marvell has had warning letters miss marvell ? she has been here ? she has just left . as i was saying if she as the holder of one of the twin diamonds has received a mysterious series of warnings you as the holder of the other stone must necessarily have done the same . you see how simple it is ? i am right then you have received these strange communications also ? for a moment she hesitated as though in doubt whether to trust me or not then she bowed her head in assent with a little smile . that is so she acknowledged . were yours too left by handby a chinaman ? no they came by post but tell me has miss marvell undergone the same experience then ? i recounted to her the events of the morning . she listened attentively . it all fits in . my letters are the duplicates of hers . it is true that they came by post but there is a curious perfume impregnating themsomething in the nature of jossstickthat at once suggested the east to me . what does it all mean ? i shook my head . that is what we must find out . you have the letters with you ? we might learn something from the postmarks . unfortunately i destroyed them . you understand at the time i regarded it as some foolish joke . can it be true that some chinese gang are really trying to recover the diamonds ? it seems too incredible . we went over the facts again and again but could get no further towards the elucidation of the mystery . at last lady yardly rose . i really dont think i need wait for monsieur poirot . you can tell him all this cant you ? thank you so much mr . she hesitated her hand outstretched . captain hastings . of course how stupid of me . youre a friend of the cavendishes arent you ? it was mary cavendish who sent me to monsieur poirot . when my friend returned i enjoyed telling him the tale of what had occurred during his absence . he crossquestioned me rather sharply over the details of our conversation and i could read between the lines that he was not best pleased to have been absent . i also fancied that the dear old fellow was just the least inclined to be jealous . it had become rather a pose with him to consistently belittle my abilities and i think he was chagrined at finding no loophole for criticism . i was secretly rather pleased with myself though i tried to conceal the fact for fear of irritating him . in spite of his idiosyncrasies i was deeply attached to my quaint little friend . bien he said at length with a curious look on his face . the plot develops . pass me i pray you that peerage on the top shelf there . he turned the leaves . ah here we are yardly  .  .  . th viscount served south african war  .  .  . tout a na pas dimportance  .  .  . mar .  hon . maude stopperton fourth daughter of rd baron cotteril  .  .  . um um um  .  .  . has iss . two daughters born   .  .  .  . clubs  .  .  . residences .  .  .  . voil that does not tell us much . but tomorrow morning we see this milord what ? yes . i telegraphed to him . i thought you had washed your hands of the case ? i am not acting for miss marvell since she refuses to be guided by my advice . what i do now is for my own satisfactionthe satisfaction of hercule poirot decidedly i must have a finger in this pie . and you calmly wire lord yardly to dash up to town just to suit your convenience . he wont be pleased . au contraire if i preserve for him his family diamond he ought to be very grateful . then you really think there is a chance of it being stolen ? i asked eagerly . almost a certainty replied poirot placidly . everything points that way . but how poirot stopped my eager questions with an airy gesture of the hand . not now i pray you . let us not confuse the mind . and observe that peeragehow you have replaced him see you not that the tallest books go in the top shelf the next tallest in the row beneath and so on . thus we have order method which as i have often told you hastings exactly i said hastily and put the offending volume in its proper place .        lord yardly turned out to be a cheery loudvoiced sportsman with a rather red face but with a goodhumoured bonhomie about him that was distinctly attractive and made up for any lack of mentality . extraordinary business this monsieur poirot . cant make head or tail of it . seems my wifes been getting odd kind of letters and that this miss marvells had em too . what does it all mean ? poirot handed him the copy of society gossip . first milord i would ask you if these facts are substantially correct ? the peer took it . his face darkened with anger as he read . damned nonsense he spluttered . theres never been any romantic story attaching to the diamond . it came from india originally i believe . i never heard of all this chinese god stuff . still the stone is known as the star of the east . well what if it is ? he demanded wrathfully . poirot smiled a little but made no direct reply . what i would ask you to do milord is to place yourself in my hands . if you do so unreservedly i have great hopes of averting the catastrophe . then you think theres actually something in these wildcat tales ? will you do as i ask you ? of course i will but bien then permit that i ask you a few questions . this affair of yardly chase is it as you say all fixed up between you and mr . rolf ? oh he told you about it did he ? no theres nothing settled . he hesitated the brickred colour of his face deepening . might as well get the thing straight . ive made rather an ass of myself in many ways monsieur poirotand im head over ears in debtbut i want to pull up . im fond of the kids and i want to straighten things up and be able to live on at the old place . gregory rolf is offering me big moneyenough to set me on my feet again . i dont want to do iti hate the thought of all that crowd playacting round the chasebut i may have to unless he broke off . poirot eyed him keenly . you have then another string to your bow ? permit that i make a guess ? it is to sell the star of the east ? lord yardly nodded . thats it . its been in the family for some generations but its not entailed . still its not the easiest thing in the world to find a purchaser . hoffberg the hatton garden man is on the lookout for a likely customer but hell have to find one soon or its a washout . one more question permettezlady yardly which plan does she approve ? oh shes bitterly opposed to my selling the jewel . you know what women are . shes all for this film stunt . i comprehend said poirot . he remained a moment or so in thought then rose briskly to his feet . you return to yardly chase at once ? bien say no word to anyoneto anyone mindbut expect us there this evening . we will arrive shortly after five . all right but i dont see a na pas dimportance said poirot kindly . you will that i preserve for you your diamond nestce pas ? yes but then do as i say . a sadly bewildered nobleman left the room .        it was halfpast five when we arrived at yardly chase and followed the dignified butler to the old panelled hall with its fire of blazing logs . a pretty picture met our eyes lady yardly and her two children the mothers proud dark head bent down over the two fair ones . lord yardly stood near smiling down on them . monsieur poirot and captain hastings announced the butler . lady yardly looked up with a start her husband came forward uncertainly his eyes seeking instruction from poirot . the little man was equal to the occasion . all my excuses it is that i investigate still this affair of miss marvells . she comes to you on friday does she not ? i make a little tour first to make sure that all is secure . also i wanted to ask of lady yardly if she recollected at all the postmarks on the letters she received ? lady yardly shook her head regretfully . im afraid i dont . it is stupid of me . but you see i never dreamt of taking them seriously . youll stay the night ? said lord yardly . oh milord i fear to incommode you . we have left our bags at the inn . thats all right . lord yardly had his cue . well send down for them . no nono trouble i assure you . poirot permitted himself to be persuaded and sitting down by lady yardly began to make friends with the children . in a short time they were all romping together and had dragged me into the game . vous tes bonne mre said poirot with a gallant little bow as the children were removed reluctantly by a stern nurse . lady yardly smoothed her ruffled hair . i adore them she said with a little catch in her voice . and they youwith reason poirot bowed again . a dressinggong sounded and we rose to go up to our rooms . at that moment the butler entered with a telegram on a salver which he handed to lord yardly . the latter tore it open with a brief word of apology . as he read it he stiffened visibly . with an ejaculation he handed it to his wife . then he glanced at my friend . just a minute monsieur poirot . i feel you ought to know about this . its from hoffberg . he thinks hes found a customer for the diamondan american sailing for the states tomorrow . theyre sending down a chap tonight to vet the stone . by jove though if this goes through words failed him . lady yardly had turned away . she still held the telegram in her hand . i wish you wouldnt sell it george she said in a low voice . its been in the family so long . she waited as though for a reply but when none came her face hardened . she shrugged her shoulders . i must go and dress . i suppose i had better display the goods . she turned to poirot with a slight grimace . its one of the most hideous necklaces that was ever designed george has always promised to have the stones reset for me but its never been done . she left the room . half an hour later we three were assembled in the great drawingroom awaiting the lady . it was already a few minutes past the dinner hour . suddenly there was a low rustle and lady yardly appeared framed in the doorway a radiant figure in a long white shimmering dress . round the column of her neck was a rivulet of fire . she stood there with one hand just touching the necklace . behold the sacrifice she said gaily . her illhumour seemed to have vanished . wait while i turn the big light on and you shall feast your eyes on the ugliest necklace in england . the switches were just outside the door . as she stretched out her hand to them the incredible thing happened . suddenly without any warning every light was extinguished the door banged and from the other side of it came a longdrawn piercing womans scream . my god cried lord yardly . that was maudes voice what has happened ? we rushed blindly for the door cannoning into each other in the darkness . it was some minutes before we could find it . what a sight met our eyes lady yardly lay senseless on the marble floor a crimson mark on her white throat where the necklace had been wrenched from her neck . as we bent over her uncertain for the moment whether she were dead or alive her eyelids opened . the chinaman she whispered painfully . the chinamanthe side door . lord yardly sprang up with an oath . i accompanied him my heart beating wildly . the chinaman again the side door in question was a small one in the angle of the wall not more than a dozen yards from the scene of the tragedy . as we reached it i gave a cry . there just short of the threshold lay the glittering necklace evidently dropped by the thief in the panic of his flight . i swooped joyously down on it . then i uttered another cry which lord yardly echoed . for in the middle of the necklace was a great gap . the star of the east was missing that settles it i breathed . these were no ordinary thieves . this one stone was all they wanted . but how did the fellow get in ? through this door . but its always locked . i shook my head . its not locked now . see . i pulled it open as i spoke . as i did so something fluttered to the ground . i picked it up . it was a piece of silk and the embroidery was unmistakable . it had been torn from a chinamans robe . in his haste it caught in the door i explained . come hurry . he cannot have gone far as yet . but in vain we hunted and searched . in the pitch darkness of the night the thief had found it easy to make his getaway . we returned reluctantly and lord yardly sent off one of the footmen posthaste to fetch the police . lady yardly aptly ministered to by poirot who is as good as a woman in these matters was sufficiently recovered to be able to tell her story . i was just going to turn on the other light she said when a man sprang on me from behind . he tore my necklace from my neck with such force that i fell headlong to the floor . as i fell i saw him disappearing through the side door . then i realized by the pigtail and the embroidered robe that he was a chinaman . she stopped with a shudder . the butler reappeared . he spoke in a low voice to lord yardly . a gentleman from mr . hoffbergs mlord . he says you expect him . good heavens cried the distracted nobleman . i must see him i suppose . no not here mullings in the library . i drew poirot aside . look here my dear fellow hadnt we better get back to london ? you think so hastings ? why ? welli coughed delicatelythings havent gone very well have they ? i mean you tell lord yardly to place himself in your hands and all will be welland then the diamond vanishes from under your very nose true said poirot rather crestfallen . it was not one of my most striking triumphs . this way of describing events almost caused me to smile but i stuck to my guns . so havingpardon the expressionrather made a mess of things dont you think it would be more graceful to leave immediately ? and the dinner the without doubt excellent dinner that the chef of lord yardly has prepared ? oh whats dinner i said impatiently . poirot held up his hands in horror . mon dieu it is that in this country you treat the affairs gastronomic with a criminal indifference . theres another reason why we should get back to london as soon as possible i continued . what is that my friend ? the other diamond i said lowering my voice . miss marvells . eh bien what of it ? dont you see ? his unusual obtuseness annoyed me . what had happened to his usually keen wits ? theyve got one now theyll go for the other . tiens cried poirot stepping back a pace and regarding me with admiration . but your brain marches to a marvel my friend figure to yourself that for the moment i had not thought of that but there is plenty of time . the full of the moon it is not until friday . i shook my head dubiously . the full of the moon theory left me entirely cold . i had my way with poirot however and we departed immediately leaving behind us a note of explanation and apology for lord yardly . my idea was to go at once to the magnificent and relate to miss marvell what had occurred but poirot vetoed the plan and insisted that the morning would be time enough . i gave in rather grudgingly . in the morning poirot seemed strangely disinclined to stir out . i began to suspect that having made a mistake to start with he was singularly loath to proceed with the case . in answer to my persuasions he pointed out with admirable common sense that as the details of the affair at yardly chase were already in the morning papers the rolfs would know quite as much as we could tell them . i gave way unwillingly . events proved my forebodings to be justified . about two oclock the telephone rang . poirot answered it . he listened for some moments then with a brief bien jy serai he rang off and turned to me . what do you think mon ami ? he looked half ashamed half excited . the diamond of miss marvell it has been stolen . what ? i cried springing up . and what about the full of the moon now ? poirot hung his head . when did this happen ? this morning i understand . i shook my head sadly . if only you had listened to me . you see i was right . it appears so mon ami said poirot cautiously . appearances are deceptive they say but it certainly appears so . as we hurried in a taxi to the magnificent i puzzled out the true inwardness of the scheme . that full of the moon idea was clever . the whole point of it was to get us to concentrate on the friday and so be off our guard beforehand . it is a pity you did not realize that . ma foi said poirot airily his nonchalance quite restored after its brief eclipse . one cannot think of everything i felt sorry for him . he did so hate failure of any kind . cheer up i said consolingly . better luck next time . at the magnificent we were ushered at once into the managers office . gregory rolf was there with two men from scotland yard . a palefaced clerk sat opposite them . rolf nodded to us as we entered . were getting to the bottom of it he said . but its almost unbelievable . how the guy had the nerve i cant think . a very few minutes sufficed to give us the facts . mr . rolf had gone out of the hotel at  . . at  . a gentleman so like him in appearance as to pass muster entered the hotel and demanded the jewelcase from the safe deposit . he duly signed the receipt remarking carelessly as he did so looks a bit different from my ordinary one but i hurt my hand getting out of the taxi . the clerk merely smiled and remarked that he saw very little difference . rolf laughed and said well dont run me in as a crook this time anyway . ive been getting threatening letters from a chinaman and the worst of it is i look rather like a chink myselfits something about the eyes . i looked at him said the clerk who was telling us this and i saw at once what he meant . the eyes slanted up at the corners like an orientals . id never noticed it before . darn it all man roared gregory rolf leaning forward do you notice it now ? the man looked up at him and started . no sir he said . i cant say i do . and indeed there was nothing even remotely oriental about the frank brown eyes that looked into ours . the scotland yard man grunted . bold customer . thought the eyes might be noticed and took the bull by the horns to disarm suspicion . he must have watched you out of the hotel sir and nipped in as soon as you were well away . what about the jewelcase ? i asked . it was found in a corridor of the hotel . only one thing had been takenthe western star . we stared at each otherthe whole thing was so bizarre so unreal . poirot hopped briskly to his feet . i have not been of much use i fear he said regretfully . is it permitted to see madame ? i guess shes prostrated with the shock explained rolf . then perhaps i might have a few words alone with you monsieur ? certainly . in about five minutes poirot reappeared . now my friend he said gaily . to a post office . i have to send a telegram . who to ? lord yardly . he discounted further inquiries by slipping his arm through mine . come come mon ami . i know all that you feel about this miserable business . i have not distinguished myself you in my place might have distinguished yourself bien all is admitted . let us forget it and have lunch . it was about four oclock when we entered poirots rooms . a figure rose from a chair by the window . it was lord yardly . he looked haggard and distraught . i got your wire and came up at once . look here ive been round to hoffberg and they know nothing about that man of theirs last night or the wire either . do you think that poirot held up his hand . my excuses i sent that wire and hired the gentleman in question . youbut why ? what ? the nobleman spluttered impotently . my little idea was to bring things to a head explained poirot placidly . bring things to a head oh my god cried lord yardly . and the ruse succeeded said poirot cheerfully . therefore milord i have much pleasure in returning youthis with a dramatic gesture he produced a glittering object . it was a great diamond . the star of the east gasped lord yardly . but i dont understand no ? said poirot . it makes no matter . believe me it was necessary for the diamond to be stolen . i promised you that it should be preserved to you and i have kept my word . you must permit me to keep my little secret . convey i beg of you the assurances of my deepest respect to lady yardly and tell her how pleased i am to be able to restore her jewel to her . what beau temps is it not ? good day milord . and smiling and talking the amazing little man conducted the bewildered nobleman to the door . he returned gently rubbing his hands . poirot i said . am i quite demented ? no mon ami but you are as always in a mental fog . how did you get the diamond . from mr . rolf . rolf ? mais oui the warning letters the chinaman the article in society gossip all sprang from the ingenious brain of mr . rolf the two diamonds supposed to be so miraculously alikebah they did not exist . there was only one diamond my friend originally in the yardly collection for three years it has been in the possession of mr . rolf . he stole it this morning with the assistance of a touch of grease paint at the corner of each eye ah i must see him on the film he is indeed an artist celuil but why should he steal his own diamond ? i asked puzzled . for many reasons . to begin with lady yardly was getting restive . lady yardly ? you comprehend she was left much alone in california . her husband was amusing himself elsewhere . mr . rolf was handsome he had an air about him of romance . but au fond he is very businesslike ce monsieur he made love to lady yardly and then he blackmailed her . i taxed the lady with the truth the other night and she admitted it . she swore that she had only been indiscreet and i believe her . but undoubtedly rolf had letters of hers that could be twisted to bear a different interpretation . terrified by the threat of a divorce and the prospect of being separated from her children she agreed to all he wished . she had no money of her own and she was forced to permit him to substitute a paste replica for the real stone . the coincidence of the date of the appearance of the western star struck me at once . all goes well . lord yardly prepares to range himselfto settle down . and then comes the menace of the possible sale of the diamond . the substitution will be discovered . without doubt she writes off frantically to gregory rolf who has just arrived in england . he soothes her by promising to arrange alland prepares for a double robbery . in this way he will quiet the lady who might conceivably tell all to her husband an affair which would not suit our blackmailer at all he will have  insurance money aha you had forgotten that and he will still have the diamond at this point i put my finger in the pie . the arrival of a diamond expert is announced . lady yardly as i felt sure she would immediately arranges a robberyand does it very well too but hercule poirot he sees nothing but facts . what happens in actuality ? the lady switches off the light bangs the door throws the necklace down the passage and screams . she has already wrenched out the diamond with pliers upstairs but we saw the necklace round her neck i objected . i demand pardon my friend . her hand concealed the part of it where the gap would have shown . to place a piece of silk in the door beforehand is childs play of course as soon as rolf read of the robbery he arranged his own little comedy . and very well he played it what did you say to him ? i asked with lively curiosity . i said to him that lady yardly had told her husband all that i was empowered to recover the jewel and that if it were not immediately handed over proceedings would be taken . also a few more little lies which occurred to me . he was as wax in my hands i pondered the matter . it seems a little unfair on mary marvell . she has lost her diamond through no fault of her own . bah said poirot brutally . she has a magnificent advertisement . that is all she cares for that one now the other she is different . bonne mre trs femme yes i said doubtfully hardly sharing poirots views on femininity . i suppose it was rolf who sent her the duplicate letters . pas du tout said poirot briskly . she came by the advice of mary cavendish to seek my aid in her dilemma . then she heard that mary marvell whom she knew to be her enemy had been here and she changed her mind jumping at a pretext that you my friend offered her . a very few questions sufficed to show me that you told her of the letters not she you she jumped at the chance your words offered . i dont believe it i cried stung . si si mon ami it is a pity that you study not the psychology . she told you that the letters were destroyed ? oh la la never does a woman destroy a letter if she can avoid it not even if it would be more prudent to do so its all very well i said my anger rising but youve made a perfect fool of me from beginning to end no its all very well to try and explain it away afterwards . there really is a limit but you were so enjoying yourself my friend . i had not the heart to shatter your illusions . its no good . youve gone a bit too far this time . mon dieu but how you enrage yourself for nothing mon ami im fed up i went out banging the door . poirot had made an absolute laughingstock of me . i decided that he needed a sharp lesson . i would let some time elapse before i forgave him . he had encouraged me to make a perfect fool of myself ii the tragedy at marsdon manor i had been called away from town for a few days and on my return found poirot in the act of strapping up his small valise . a la bonne heure hastings . i feared you would not have returned in time to accompany me . you are called away on a case then ? yes though i am bound to admit that on the face of it the affair does not seem promising . the northern union insurance company have asked me to investigate the death of a mr . maltravers who a few weeks ago insured his life with them for the large sum of fifty thousand pounds . yes ? i said much interested . there was of course the usual suicide clause in the policy . in the event of his committing suicide within a year the premiums would be forfeited . mr . maltravers was duly examined by the companys own doctor and although he was a man slightly past the prime of life was passed as being in quite sound health . however on wednesday lastthe day before yesterdaythe body of mr . maltravers was found in the grounds of his house in essex marsdon manor and the cause of his death is described as some kind of internal hmorrhage . that in itself would be nothing remarkable but sinister rumours as to mr . maltravers financial position have been in the air of late and the northern union have ascertained beyond any possible doubt that the deceased gentleman stood upon the verge of bankruptcy . now that alters matters considerably . maltravers had a beautiful young wife and it is suggested that he got together all the ready money he could for the purpose of paying the premiums on a life insurance for his wifes benefit and then committed suicide . such a thing is not uncommon . in any case my friend alfred wright who is a director of the northern union has asked me to investigate the facts of the case but as i told him i am not very hopeful of success . if the cause of the death had been heart failure i should have been more sanguine . heart failure may always be translated as the inability of the local g .p . to discover what his patient really did die of but a hmorrhage seems fairly definite . still we can but make some necessary inquiries . five minutes to pack your bag hastings and we will take a taxi to liverpool street . about an hour later we alighted from a great eastern train at the little station of marsdon leigh . inquiries at the station yielded the information that marsdon manor was about a mile distant . poirot decided to walk and we betook ourselves along the main street . what is our plan of campaign ? i asked . first i will call upon the doctor . i have ascertained that there is only one doctor in marsdon leigh dr . ralph bernard . ah here we are at his house . the house in question was a kind of superior cottage standing back a little from the road . a brass plate on the gate bore the doctors name . we passed up the path and rang the bell . we proved to be fortunate in our call . it was the doctors consulting hour and for the moment there were no patients waiting for him . dr . bernard was an elderly man highshouldered and stooping with a pleasant vagueness of manner . poirot introduced himself and explained the purpose of our visit adding that insurance companies were bound to investigate fully in a case of this kind . of course of course said dr . bernard vaguely . i suppose as he was such a rich man his life was insured for a big sum ? you consider him a rich man doctor ? the doctor looked rather surprised . was he not ? he kept two cars you know and marsdon manor is a pretty big place to keep up although i believe he bought it very cheap . i understand that he had had considerable losses of late said poirot watching the doctor narrowly . the latter however merely shook his head sadly . is that so ? indeed . it is fortunate for his wife then that there is this life insurance . a very beautiful and charming young creature but terribly unstrung by this sad catastrophe . a mass of nerves poor thing . i have tried to spare her all i can but of course the shock was bound to be considerable . you had been attending mr . maltravers recently ? my dear sir i never attended him . what ? i understand mr . maltravers was a christian scientistor something of that kind . but you examined the body ? certainly . i was fetched by one of the undergardeners . and the cause of death was clear ? absolutely . there was blood on the lips but most of the bleeding must have been internal . was he still lying where he had been found ? yes the body had not been touched . he was lying at the edge of a small plantation . he had evidently been out shooting rooks a small rook rifle lay beside him . the hmorrhage must have occurred quite suddenly . gastric ulcer without a doubt . no question of his having been shot eh ? my dear sir i demand pardon said poirot humbly . but if my memory is not at fault in the case of a recent murder the doctor first gave a verdict of heart failurealtering it when the local constable pointed out that there was a bullet wound through the head you will not find any bullet wounds on the body of mr . maltravers said dr . bernard dryly . now gentlemen if there is nothing further we took the hint . good morning and many thanks to you doctor for so kindly answering our questions . by the way you saw no need for an autopsy ? certainly not . the doctor became quite apoplectic . the cause of death was clear and in my profession we see no need to distress unduly the relatives of a dead patient . and turning the doctor slammed the door sharply in our faces . and what do you think of dr . bernard hastings ? inquired poirot as we proceeded on our way to the manor . rather an old ass . exactly . your judgments of character are always profound my friend . i glanced at him uneasily but he seemed perfectly serious . a twinkle however came into his eye and he added slyly that is to say when there is no question of a beautiful woman i looked at him coldly . on our arrival at the manorhouse the door was opened to us by a middleaged parlourmaid . poirot handed her his card and a letter from the insurance company for mrs . maltravers . she showed us into a small morningroom and retired to tell her mistress . about ten minutes elapsed and then the door opened and a slender figure in widows weeds stood upon the threshold . monsieur poirot ? she faltered . madame poirot sprang gallantly to his feet and hastened towards her . i cannot tell you how i regret to derange you in this way . but what will you ? les affairesthey know no mercy . mrs . maltravers permitted him to lead her to a chair . her eyes were red with weeping but the temporary disfigurement could not conceal her extraordinary beauty . she was about twentyseven or eight and very fair with large blue eyes and a pretty pouting mouth . it is something about my husbands insurance is it ? but must i be bothered nowso soon ? courage my dear madame . courage you see your late husband insured his life for rather a large sum and in such a case the company always has to satisfy itself as to a few details . they have empowered me to act for them . you can rest assured that i will do all in my power to render the matter not too unpleasant for you . will you recount to me briefly the sad events of wednesday ? i was changing for tea when my maid came upone of the gardeners had just run to the house . he had found her voice trailed away . poirot pressed her hand sympathetically . i comprehend . enough you had seen your husband earlier in the afternoon ? not since lunch . i had walked down to the village for some stamps and i believe he was out pottering round the grounds . shooting rooks eh ? yes he usually took his little rook rifle with him and i heard one or two shots in the distance . where is this little rook rifle now ? in the hall i think . she led the way out of the room and found and handed the little weapon to poirot who examined it cursorily . two shots fired i see he observed as he handed it back . and now madame if i might see he paused delicately . the servant shall take you she murmured averting her head . the parlourmaid summoned led poirot upstairs . i remained with the lovely and unfortunate woman . it was hard to know whether to speak or remain silent . i essayed one or two general reflections to which she responded absently and in a very few minutes poirot rejoined us . i thank you for all your courtesy madame . i do not think you need be troubled any further with this matter . by the way do you know anything of your husbands financial position ? she shook her head . nothing whatever . i am very stupid over business things . i see . then you can give us no clue as to why he suddenly decided to insure his life ? he had not done so previously i understand . well we had only been married a little over a year . but as to why he insured his life it was because he had absolutely made up his mind that he would not live long . he had a strong premonition of his own death . i gather that he had had one hmorrhage already and that he knew that another one would prove fatal . i tried to dispel these gloomy fears of his but without avail . alas he was only too right tears in her eyes she bade us a dignified farewell . poirot made a characteristic gesture as we walked down the drive together . eh bien that is that back to london my friend there appears to be no mouse in this mousehole . and yet yet what ? a slight discrepancy that is all you noticed it ? you did not ? still life is full of discrepancies and assuredly the man cannot have taken his own lifethere is no poison that would fill his mouth with blood . no no i must resign myself to the fact that all here is clear and aboveboardbut who is this ? a tall young man was striding up the drive towards us . he passed us without making any sign but i noted that he was not illlooking with a lean deeply bronzed face that spoke of life in a tropic clime . a gardener who was sweeping up leaves had paused for a minute in his task and poirot ran quickly up to him . tell me i pray you who is that gentleman ? do you know him ? i dont remember his name sir though i did hear it . he was staying down here last week for a night . tuesday it was . quick mon ami let us follow him . we hastened up the drive after the retreating figure . a glimpse of a blackrobed figure on the terrace at the side of the house and our quarry swerved and we after him so that we were witnesses of the meeting . mrs . maltravers almost staggered where she stood and her face blanched noticeably . you she gasped . i thought you were on the seaon your way to east africa ? i got some news from my lawyers that detained me explained the young man . my old uncle in scotland died unexpectedly and left me some money . under the circumstances i thought it better to cancel my passage . then i saw this bad news in the paper and i came down to see if there was anything i could do . youll want some one to look after things for you a bit perhaps . at that moment they became aware of our presence . poirot stepped forward and with many apologies explained that he had left his stick in the hall . rather reluctantly it seemed to me mrs . maltravers made the necessary introduction . monsieur poirot captain black . a few minutes chat ensued in the course of which poirot elicited the fact that captain black was putting up at the anchor inn . the missing stick not having been discovered which was not surprising poirot uttered more apologies and we withdrew . we returned to the village at a great pace and poirot made a bee line for the anchor inn . here we establish ourselves until our friend the captain returns he explained . you notice that i emphasized the point that we were returning to london by the first train ? possibly you thought i meant it . but noyou observed mrs . maltravers face when she caught sight of this young black ? she was clearly taken aback and heeh bien he was very devoted did you not think so ? and he was here on tuesday nightthe day before mr . maltravers died . we must investigate the doings of captain black hastings . in about half an hour we espied our quarry approaching the inn . poirot went out and accosted him and presently brought him up to the room we had engaged . i have been telling captain black of the mission which brings us here he explained . you can understand monsieur le capitaine that i am anxious to arrive at mr . maltravers state of mind immediately before his death and that at the same time i do not wish to distress mrs . maltravers unduly by asking her painful questions . now you were here just before the occurrence and can give us equally valuable information . ill do anything i can to help you im sure replied the young soldier but im afraid i didnt notice anything out of the ordinary . you see although maltravers was an old friend of my peoples i didnt know him very well myself . you came downwhen ? tuesday afternoon . i went up to town early wednesday morning as my boat sailed from tilbury about twelve oclock . but some news i got made me alter my plans as i dare say you heard me explain to mrs . maltravers . you were returning to east africa i understand ? yes . ive been out there ever since the wara great country . exactly . now what was the talk about at dinner on tuesday night ? oh i dont know . the usual odd topics . maltravers asked after my people and then we discussed the question of german reparations and then mrs . maltravers asked a lot of questions about east africa and i told them one or two yarns thats about all i think . thank you . poirot was silent for a moment then he said gently with your permission i should like to try a little experiment . you have told us all that your conscious self knows i want now to question your subconscious self . psychoanalysis what ? said black with visible alarm . oh no said poirot reassuringly . you see it is like this i give you a word you answer with another and so on . any word the first one you think of . shall we begin ? all right said black slowly but he looked uneasy . note down the words please hastings said poirot . then he took from his pocket his big turnipfaced watch and laid it on the table beside him . we will commence . day . there was a moments pause and then black replied night . as poirot proceeded his answers came quicker . name said poirot . place . bernard . shaw . tuesday . dinner . journey . ship . country . uganda . story . lions . rook rifle . farm . shot . suicide . elephant . tusks . money . lawyers . thank you captain black . perhaps you could spare me a few minutes in about half an hours time ? certainly . the young soldier looked at him curiously and wiped his brow as he got up . and now hastings said poirot smiling at me as the door closed behind him . you see it all do you not ? i dont know what you mean . does that list of words tell you nothing ? i scrutinized it but was forced to shake my head . i will assist you . to begin with black answered well within the normal time limit with no pauses so we can take it that he himself has no guilty knowledge to conceal . day to night and place to name are normal associations . i began work with bernard which might have suggested the local doctor had he come across him at all . evidently he had not . after our recent conversation he gave dinner to my tuesday but journey and country were answered by ship and uganda showing clearly that it was his journey abroad that was important to him and not the one which brought him down here . story recalls to him one of the lion stories he told at dinner . i proceed to rook rifle and he answered with the totally unexpected word farm . when i say shot he answers at once suicide . the association seems clear . a man he knows committed suicide with a rook rifle on a farm somewhere . remember too that his mind is still on the stories he told at dinner and i think you will agree that i shall not be far from the truth if i recall captain black and ask him to repeat the particular suicide story which he told at the dinnertable on tuesday evening . black was straightforward enough over the matter . yes i did tell them that story now that i come to think of it . chap shot himself on a farm out there . did it with a rook rifle through the roof of the mouth bullet lodged in the brain . doctors were no end puzzled over itthere was nothing to show except a little blood on the lips . but what what has it got to do with mr . maltravers ? you did not know i see that he was found with a rook rifle by his side . you mean my story suggested to himoh but that is awful do not distress yourselfit would have been one way or another . well i must get on the telephone to london . poirot had a lengthy conversation over the wire and came back thoughtful . he went off by himself in the afternoon and it was not till seven oclock that he announced that he could put it off no longer but must break the news to the young widow . my sympathy had already gone out to her unreservedly . to be left penniless and with the knowledge that her husband had killed himself to assure her future was a hard burden for any woman to bear . i cherished a secret hope however that young black might prove capable of consoling her after her first grief had passed . he evidently admired her enormously . our interview with the lady was painful . she refused vehemently to believe the facts that poirot advanced and when she was at last convinced broke down into bitter weeping . an examination of the body turned our suspicions into certainty . poirot was very sorry for the poor lady but after all he was employed by the insurance company and what could he do ? as he was preparing to leave he said gently to mrs . maltravers madame you of all people should know that there are no dead what do you mean ? she faltered her eyes growing wide . have you never taken part in any spiritualistic sances ? you are mediumistic you know . i have been told so . but you do not believe in spiritualism surely ? madame i have seen some strange things . you know that they say in the village that this house is haunted ? she nodded and at that moment the parlourmaid announced that dinner was ready . wont you just stay and have something to eat ? we accepted gratefully and i felt that our presence could not but help distract her a little from her own griefs . we had just finished our soup when there was a scream outside the door and the sound of breaking crockery . we jumped up . the parlourmaid appeared her hand to her heart . it was a manstanding in the passage . poirot rushed out returning quickly . there is no one there . isnt there sir ? said the parlourmaid weakly . oh it did give me a start but why ? she dropped her voice to a whisper . i thoughti thought it was the masterit looked like im . i saw mrs . maltravers give a terrified start and my mind flew to the old superstition that a suicide cannot rest . she thought of it too i am sure for a minute later she caught poirots arm with a scream . didnt you hear that ? those three taps on the window ? thats how he always used to tap when he passed round the house . the ivy i cried . it was the ivy against the pane . but a sort of terror was gaining on us all . the parlourmaid was obviously unstrung and when the meal was over mrs . maltravers besought poirot not to go at once . she was clearly terrified to be left alone . we sat in the little morningroom . the wind was getting up and moaning round the house in an eerie fashion . twice the door of the room came unlatched and the door slowly opened and each time she clung to me with a terrified gasp . ah but this door it is bewitched cried poirot angrily at last . he got up and shut it once more then turned the key in the lock . i shall lock it so dont do that she gasped if it should come open now and even as she spoke the impossible happened . the locked door slowly swung open . i could not see into the passage from where i sat but she and poirot were facing it . she gave one long shriek as she turned to him . you saw himthere in the passage ? she cried . he was staring down at her with a puzzled face then shook his head . i saw himmy husbandyou must have seen him too ? madame i saw nothing . you are not wellunstrung i am perfectly well ioh god suddenly without any warning the lights quivered and went out . out of the darkness came three loud raps . i could hear mrs . maltravers moaning . and theni saw the man i had seen on the bed upstairs stood there facing us gleaming with a faint ghostly light . there was blood on his lips and he held his right hand out pointing . suddenly a brilliant light seemed to proceed from it . it passed over poirot and me and fell on mrs . maltravers . i saw her white terrified face and something else my god poirot i cried . look at her hand her right hand . its all red her own eyes fell on it and she collapsed in a heap on the floor . blood she cried hysterically . yes its blood . i killed him . i did it . he was showing me and then i put my hand on the trigger and pressed . save me from himsave me hes come back her voice died away in a gurgle . lights said poirot briskly . the lights went on as if by magic . thats it he continued . you heard hastings ? and you everett ? oh by the way this is mr . everett rather a fine member of the theatrical profession . i phoned to him this afternoon . his makeup is good isnt it ? quite like the dead man and with a pocket torch and the necessary phosphorescence he made the proper impression . i shouldnt touch her right hand if i were you hastings . red paint marks so . when the lights went out i clasped her hand you see . by the way we mustnt miss our train . inspector japp is outside the window . a bad nightbut he has been able to while away the time by tapping on the window every now and then . you see continued poirot as we walked briskly through the wind and rain there was a little discrepancy . the doctor seemed to think the deceased was a christian scientist and who could have given him that impression but mrs . maltravers ? but to us she represented him as being in a grave state of apprehension about his own health . again why was she so taken aback by the reappearance of young black ? and lastly although i know that convention decrees that a woman must make a decent pretence of mourning for her husband i do not care for such heavilyrouged eyelids you did not observe them hastings ? no ? as i always tell you you see nothing well there it was . there were the two possibilities . did blacks story suggest an ingenious method of committing suicide to mr . maltravers or did his other listener the wife see an equally ingenious method of committing murder ? i inclined to the latter view . to shoot himself in the way indicated he would probably have had to pull the trigger with his toeor at least so i imagine . now if maltravers had been found with one boot off we should almost certainly have heard of it from some one . an odd detail like that would have been remembered . no as i say i inclined to the view that it was a case of murder not suicide but i realized that i had not a shadow of proof in support of my theory . hence the elaborate little comedy you saw played tonight . even now i dont quite see all the details of the crime ? i said . let us start from the beginning . here is a shrewd and scheming woman who knowing of her husbands financial dbcle and tired of the elderly mate she has only married for his money induces him to insure his life for a large sum and then seeks for the means to accomplish her purpose . an accident gives her thatthe young soldiers strange story . the next afternoon when monsieur le capitaine as she thinks is on the high seas she and her husband are strolling round the grounds . what a curious story that was last night she observes . could a man shoot himself in such a way ? do show me if it is possible the poor foolhe shows her . he places the end of the rifle in his mouth . she stoops down and puts her finger on the trigger laughing up at him . and now sir she says saucily supposing i pull the trigger ? and thenand then hastingsshe pulls it iii the adventure of the cheap flat so far in the cases which i have recorded poirots investigations have started from the central fact whether murder or robbery and have proceeded from thence by a process of logical deduction to the final triumphant unravelling . in the events i am now about to chronicle a remarkable chain of circumstances led from the apparently trivial incidents which first attracted poirots attention to the sinister happenings which completed a most unusual case . i had been spending the evening with an old friend of mine gerald parker . there had been perhaps about half a dozen people there besides my host and myself and the talk fell as it was bound to do sooner or later wherever parker found himself on the subject of househunting in london . houses and flats were parkers special hobby . since the end of the war he had occupied at least half a dozen different flats and maisonnettes . no sooner was he settled anywhere than he would light unexpectedly upon a new find and would forthwith depart bag and baggage . his moves were nearly always accomplished at a slight pecuniary gain for he had a shrewd business head but it was sheer love of the sport that actuated him and not a desire to make money at it . we listened to parker for some time with the respect of the novice for the expert . then it was our turn and a perfect babel of tongues was let loose . finally the floor was left to mrs . robinson a charming little bride who was there with her husband . i had never met them before as robinson was only a recent acquaintance of parkers . talking of flats she said have you heard of our piece of luck mr . parker ? weve got a flatat last in montagu mansions . well said parker ive always said there are plenty of flatsat a price yes but this isnt at a price . its dirt cheap . eighty pounds a year butbut montagu mansions is just off knightsbridge isnt it ? big handsome building . or are you talking of a poor relation of the same name stuck in the slums somewhere ? no its the knightsbridge one . thats what makes it so wonderful . wonderful is the word its a blinking miracle . but there must be a catch somewhere . big premium i suppose ? no premium no premoh hold my head somebody groaned parker . but weve got to buy the furniture continued mrs . robinson . ah parker brisked up . i knew there was a catch for fifty pounds . and its beautifully furnished i give it up said parker . the present occupants must be lunatics with a taste for philanthropy . mrs . robinson was looking a little troubled . a little pucker appeared between her dainty brows . it is queer isnt it ? you dont think thatthatthe place is haunted ? never heard of a haunted flat declared parker decisively . no . mrs . robinson appeared far from convinced . but there were several things about it all that struck me aswell queer . for instance i suggested . ah said parker our criminal experts attention is aroused unburden yourself to him mrs . robinson . hastings is a great unraveller of mysteries . i laughed embarrassed but not wholly displeased with the rle thrust upon me . oh not really queer captain hastings but when we went to the agents stosser and paulwe hadnt tried them before because they only have the expensive mayfair flats but we thought at any rate it would do no harmeverything they offered us was four and five hundred a year or else huge premiums and then just as we were going they mentioned that they had a flat at eighty but that they doubted if it would be any good our going there because it had been on their books some time and they had sent so many people to see it that it was almost sure to be takensnapped up as the clerk put itonly people were so tiresome in not letting them know and then they went on sending and people get annoyed at being sent to a place that had perhaps been let some time . mrs . robinson paused for some much needed breath and then continued we thanked him and said that we quite understood it would probably be no good but that we should like an order all the samejust in case . and we went there straight away in a taxi for after all you never know . no .  was on the second floor and just as we were waiting for the lift elsie fergusonshes a friend of mine captain hastings and they are looking for a flat toocame hurrying down the stairs . ahead of you for once my dear she said . but its no good . its already let . that seemed to finish it butwell as john said the place was very cheap we could afford to give more and perhaps if we offered a premium .a horrid thing to do of course and i feel quite ashamed of telling you but you know what flathunting is . i assured her that i was well aware that in the struggle for houseroom the baser side of human nature frequently triumphed over the higher and that the wellknown rule of dog eat dog always applied . so we went up and would you believe it the flat wasnt let at all . we were shown over it by the maid and then we saw the mistress and the thing was settled then and there . immediate possession and fifty pounds for the furniture . we signed the agreement next day and we are to move in tomorrow mrs . robinson paused triumphantly . and what about mrs . ferguson ? asked parker . lets have your deductions hastings . obvious my dear watson i quoted lightly . she went to the wrong flat . oh captain hastings how clever of you cried mrs . robinson admiringly . i rather wished poirot had been there . sometimes i have the feeling that he rather underestimates my capabilities .        the whole thing was rather amusing and i propounded the thing as a mock problem to poirot on the following morning . he seemed interested and questioned me rather narrowly as to the rents of flats in various localities . a curious story he said thoughtfully . excuse me hastings i must take a short stroll . when he returned about an hour later his eyes were gleaming with a peculiar excitement . he laid his stick on the table and brushed the nap of his hat with his usual tender care before he spoke . it is as well mon ami that we have no affairs of moment on hand . we can devote ourselves wholly to the present investigation . what investigation are you talking about ? the remarkable cheapness of your friends mrs . robinsons new flat . poirot you are not serious i am most serious . figure to yourself my friend that the real rent of those flats is  . i have just ascertained that from the landlords agents . and yet this particular flat is being sublet at eighty pounds why ? there must be something wrong with it . perhaps it is haunted as mrs . robinson suggested . poirot shook his head in a dissatisfied manner . then again how curious it is that her friend tells her the flat is let and when she goes up behold it is not so at all but surely you agree with me that the other woman must have gone to the wrong flat . that is the only possible solution . you may or may not be right on that point hastings . the fact still remains that numerous other applicants were sent to see it and yet in spite of its remarkable cheapness it was still in the market when mrs . robinson arrived . that shows that there must be something wrong about it . mrs . robinson did not seem to notice anything amiss . very curious is it not ? did she impress you as being a truthful woman hastings ? she was a delightful creature videmment since she renders you incapable of replying to my question . describe her to me then . well shes tall and fair her hairs really a beautiful shade of auburn always you have had a penchant for auburn hair murmured poirot . but continue . blue eyes and a very nice complexion andwell thats all i think i concluded lamely . and her husband ? oh hes quite a nice fellownothing startling . dark or fair ? i dont knowbetwixt and between and just an ordinary sort of face . poirot nodded . yes there are hundreds of these average menand anyway you bring more sympathy and appreciation to your description of women . do you know anything about these people ? does parker know them well . they are just recent acquaintances i believe . but surely poirot you dont think for an instant poirot raised his hand . tout doucement mon ami . have i said that i think anything ? all i say isit is a curious story . and there is nothing to throw light upon it except perhaps the ladys name eh hastings ? her name is stella i said stiffly but i dont see poirot interrupted me with a tremendous chuckle . something seemed to be amusing him vastly . and stella means a star does it not ? famous what on earth and stars give light voil calm yourself hastings . do not put on that air of injured dignity . come we will go to montagu mansions and make a few inquiries . i accompanied him nothing loath . the mansions were a handsome block of buildings in excellent repair . a uniformed porter was sunning himself on the threshold and it was to him that poirot addressed himself pardon but could you tell me if a mr . and mrs . robinson reside here ? the porter was a man of few words and apparently of a sour or suspicious disposition . he hardly looked at us and grunted out no .  . second floor . i thank you . can you tell me how long they have been here ? six months . i started forward in amazement conscious as i did so of poirots malicious grin . impossible i cried . you must be making a mistake . six months . are you sure ? the lady i mean is tall and fair with reddish gold hair and thats er said the porter . come in the michaelmas quarter they did . just six months ago . he appeared to lose interest in us and retreated slowly up the hall . i followed poirot outside . eh bien hastings ? my friend demanded slyly . are you so sure now that delightful women always speak the truth ? i did not reply . poirot had steered his way into brompton road before i asked him what he was going to do and where we were going . to the house agents hastings . i have a great desire to have a flat in montagu mansions . if i am not mistaken several interesting things will take place there before long . we were fortunate in our quest . no .  on the fourth floor was to be let furnished at ten guineas a week . poirot promptly took it for a month . outside in the street again he silenced my protests but i make money nowadays why should i not indulge a whim ? by the way hastings have you a revolver ? yessomewhere i answered slightly thrilled . do you think that you will need it ? it is quite possible . the idea pleases you i see . always the spectacular and romantic appeals to you . the following day saw us installed in our temporary home . the flat was pleasantly furnished . it occupied the same position in the building as that of the robinsons but was two floors higher . the day after our installation was a sunday . in the afternoon poirot left the front door ajar and summoned me hastily as a bang reverberated from somewhere below . look over the banisters . are those your friends . do not let them see you . i craned my neck over the staircase . thats them i declared in an ungrammatical whisper . good . wait awhile . about half an hour later a young woman emerged in brilliant and varied clothing . with a sigh of satisfaction poirot tiptoed back into the flat . cest a . after the master and mistress the maid . the flat should now be empty . what are we going to do ? i asked uneasily . poirot had trotted briskly into the scullery and was hauling at the rope of the coallift . we are about to descend after the method of the dustbins he explained cheerfully . no one will observe us . the sunday concert the sunday afternoon out and finally the sunday nap after the sunday dinner of englandle rosbifall these will distract attention from the doings of hercule poirot . come my friend . he stepped into the rough wooden contrivance and i followed him gingerly . are we going to break into the flat ? i asked dubiously . poirots answer was not too reassuring not precisely today he replied . pulling on the rope we descended slowly till we reached the second floor . poirot uttered an exclamation of satisfaction as he perceived that the wooden door into the scullery was open . you observe ? never do they bolt these doors in the daytime . and yet anyone could mount or descend as we have done . at night yesthough not always thenand it is against that that we are going to make provision . he had drawn some tools from his pocket as he spoke and at once set deftly to work his object being to arrange the bolt so that it could be pulled back from the lift . the operation only occupied about three minutes . then poirot returned the tools to his pocket and we reascended once more to our own domain .        on monday poirot was out all day but when he returned in the evening he flung himself into his chair with a sigh of satisfaction . hastings shall i recount to you a little history ? a story after your own heart and which will remind you of your favourite cinema ? go ahead i laughed . i presume that it is a true story not one of your efforts of fancy . it is true enough . inspector japp of scotland yard will vouch for its accuracy since it was through his kind offices that it came to my ears . listen hastings . a little over six months ago some important naval plans were stolen from an american government department . they showed the position of some of the most important harbour defences and would be worth a considerable sum to any foreign governmentthat of japan for example . suspicion fell upon a young man named luigi valdarno an italian by birth who was employed in a minor capacity in the department and who was missing at the same time as the papers . whether luigi valdarno was the thief or not he was found two days later on the east side in new york shot dead . the papers were not on him . now for some time past luigi valdarno had been going about with a miss elsa hardt a young concert singer who had recently appeared and who lived with a brother in an apartment in washington . nothing was known of the antecedents of miss elsa hardt and she disappeared suddenly about the time of valdarnos death . there are reasons for believing that she was in reality an accomplished international spy who has done much nefarious work under various aliases . the american secret service whilst doing their best to trace her also kept an eye upon certain insignificant japanese gentlemen living in washington . they felt pretty certain that when elsa hardt had covered her tracks sufficiently she would approach the gentlemen in question . one of them left suddenly for england a fortnight ago . on the face of it therefore it would seem that elsa hardt is in england . poirot paused and then added softly the official description of elsa hardt is height  ft .  eyes blue hair auburn fair complexion nose straight no special distinguishing marks . mrs . robinson i gasped . well there is a chance of it anyhow amended poirot . also i learn that a swarthy man a foreigner of some kind was inquiring about the occupants of no .  only this morning . therefore mon ami i fear that you must forswear your beauty sleep tonight and join me in my allnight vigil in the flat belowarmed with that excellent revolver of yours bien entendu rather i cried with enthusiasm . when shall we start ? the hour of midnight is both solemn and suitable i fancy . nothing is likely to occur before then . at twelve oclock precisely we crept cautiously into the coallift and lowered ourselves to the second floor . under poirots manipulation the wooden door quickly swung inwards and we climbed into the flat . from the scullery we passed into the kitchen where we established ourselves comfortably in two chairs with the door into the hall ajar . now we have but to wait said poirot contentedly closing his eyes . to me the waiting appeared endless . i was terrified of going to sleep . just when it seemed to me that i had been there about eight hoursand had as i found out afterwards in reality been exactly one hour and twenty minutesa faint scratching sound came to my ears . poirots hand touched mine . i rose and together we moved carefully in the direction of the hall . the noise came from there . poirot placed his lips to my ear . outside the front door . they are cutting out the lock . when i give the word not before fall upon him from behind and hold him fast . be careful he will have a knife . presently there was a rending sound and a little circle of light appeared through the door . it was extinguished immediately and then the door was slowly opened . poirot and i flattened ourselves against the wall . i heard a mans breathing as he passed us . then he flashed on his torch and as he did so poirot hissed in my ear allez . we sprang together poirot with a quick movement enveloped the intruders head with a light woollen scarf whilst i pinioned his arms . the whole affair was quick and noiseless . i twisted a dagger from his hand and as poirot brought down the scarf from his eyes whilst keeping it wound tightly round his mouth i jerked up my revolver where he could see it and understand that resistance was useless . as he ceased to struggle poirot put his mouth close to his ear and began to whisper rapidly . after a minute the man nodded . then enjoining silence with a movement of the hand poirot led the way out of the flat and down the stairs . our captive followed and i brought up the rear with the revolver . when we were out in the street poirot turned to me . there is a taxi waiting just round the corner . give me the revolver . we shall not need it now . but if this fellow tries to escape ? poirot smiled . he will not . i returned in a minute with the waiting taxi . the scarf had been unwound from the strangers face and i gave a start of surprise . hes not a jap i ejaculated in a whisper to poirot . observation was always your strong point hastings nothing escapes you . no the man is not a jap . he is an italian . we got into the taxi and poirot gave the driver an address in st . johns wood . i was by now completely fogged . i did not like to ask poirot where we were going in front of our captive and strove in vain to obtain some light upon the proceedings . we alighted at the door of a small house standing back from the road . a returning wayfarer slightly drunk was lurching along the pavement and almost collided with poirot who said something sharply to him which i did not catch . all three of us went up the steps of the house . poirot rang the bell and motioned us to stand a little aside . there was no answer and he rang again and then seized the knocker which he plied for some minutes vigorously . a light appeared suddenly above the fanlight and the door was opened cautiously a little way . what the devil do you want ? a mans voice demanded harshly . i want the doctor . my wife is taken ill . theres no doctor here . the man prepared to shut the door but poirot thrust his foot in adroitly . he became suddenly a perfect caricature of an infuriated frenchman . what you say there is no doctor ? i will have the law of you . you must come i will stay here and ring and knock all night . my dear sir the door was opened again the man clad in a dressinggown and slippers stepped forward to pacify poirot with an uneasy glance round . i will call the police . poirot prepared to descend the steps . no dont do that for heavens sake the man dashed after him . with a neat push poirot sent him staggering down the steps . in another minute all three of us were inside the door and it was pushed to and bolted . quickin here . poirot led the way into the nearest room switching on the light as he did so . and youbehind the curtain . si signor said the italian and slid rapidly behind the full folds of rosecoloured velvet which draped the embrasure of the window . not a minute too soon . just as he disappeared from view a woman rushed into the room . she was tall with reddish hair and held a scarlet kimono round her slender form . where is my husband ? she cried with a quick frightened glance . who are you ? poirot stepped forward with a bow . it is to be hoped your husband will not suffer from a chill . i observed that he had slippers on his feet and that his dressinggown was a warm one . who are you ? what are you doing in my house ? it is true that none of us have the pleasure of your acquaintance madame . it is especially to be regretted as one of our number has come specially from new york in order to meet you . the curtains parted and the italian stepped out . to my horror i observed that he was brandishing my revolver which poirot must doubtless have put down through inadvertence in the cab . the woman gave a piercing scream and turned to fly but poirot was standing in front of the closed door . let me by she shrieked . he will murder me . who was it dat croaked luigi valdarno ? asked the italian hoarsely brandishing the weapon and sweeping each one of us with it . we dared not move . my god poirot this is awful . what shall we do ? i cried . you will oblige me by refraining from talking so much hastings . i can assure you that our friend will not shoot until i give the word . youse sure o dat eh ? said the italian leering unpleasantly . it was more than i was but the woman turned to poirot like a flash . what is it you want ? poirot bowed . i do not think it is necessary to insult miss elsa hardts intelligence by telling her . with a swift movement the woman snatched up a big black velvet cat which served as a cover for the telephone . they are stitched in the lining of that . clever murmured poirot appreciatively . he stood aside from the door . good evening madame . i will detain your friend from new york whilst you make your getaway . whatta fool roared the big italian and raising the revolver he fired pointblank at the womans retreating figure just as i flung myself upon him . but the weapon merely clicked harmlessly and poirots voice rose in mild reproof . never will you trust your old friend hastings . i do not care for my friends to carry loaded pistols about with them and never would i permit a mere acquaintance to do so . no no mon ami . this to the italian who swearing hoarsely . poirot continued to address him in a tone of mild reproof see now what i have done for you . i have saved you from being hanged . and do not think that our beautiful lady will escape . no no the house is watched back and front . straight into the arms of the police they will go . is not that a beautiful and consoling thought ? yes you may leave the room now . but be carefulbe very careful . iah he is gone and my friend hastings looks at me with eyes of reproach . but it was all so simple it was clear from the first that out of several hundred probably applicants for no .  montagu mansions only the robinsons were considered suitable . why ? what was there that singled them out from the restat practically a glance . their appearance ? possibly but it was not so unusual . their name then but theres nothing unusual about the name of robinson i cried . its quite a common name . ah sapristi but exactly that was the point . elsa hardt and her husband or brother or whatever he really is come from new york and take a flat in the name of mr . and mrs . robinson . suddenly they learn that one of these secret societies the mafia or the camorra to which doubtless luigi valdarno belonged is on their track . what do they do ? they hit on a scheme of transparent simplicity . evidently they knew that their pursuers were not personally acquainted with either of them . what then can be simpler ? they offer the flat at an absurdly low rental . of the thousands of young couples in london looking for flats there cannot fail to be several robinsons . it is only a matter of waiting . if you will look at the name of robinson in the telephone directory you will realize that a fairhaired mrs . robinson was pretty sure to come along sooner or later . then what will happen ? the avenger arrives . he knows the name he knows the address . he strikes all is over vengeance is satisfied and miss elsa hardt has escaped by the skin of her teeth once more . by the way hastings you must present me to the real mrs . robinsonthat delightful and truthful creature what will they think when they find their flat has been broken into we must hurry back . ah that sounds like japp and his friends arriving . a mighty tattoo sounded on the knocker . how did you know this address ? i asked as i followed poirot out into the hall . oh of course you had the first mrs . robinson followed when she left the other flat . a la bonne heure hastings . you use your grey cells at last . now for a little surprise for japp . softly unbolting the door he stuck the cats head round the edge and ejaculated a piercing miaow . the scotland yard inspector who was standing outside with another man jumped in spite of himself . oh its only monsieur poirot at one of his little jokes he exclaimed as poirots head followed that of the cat . let us in moosior . you have our friends safe and sound ? yes weve got the birds all right . but they hadnt got the goods with them . i see . so you come to search . well i am about to depart with hastings but i should like to give you a little lecture upon the history and habits of the domestic cat . for the lords sake have you gone completely balmy ? the cat declaimed poirot was worshipped by the ancient egyptians . it is still regarded as a symbol of good luck if a black cat crosses your path . this cat crossed your path tonight japp . to speak of the interior of any animal or any person is not i know considered polite in england . but the interior of this cat is perfectly delicate . i refer to the lining . with a sudden grunt the second man seized the cat from poirots hand . oh i forgot to introduce you said japp . mr . poirot this is mr . burt of the united states secret service . the americans trained fingers had felt what he was looking for . he held out his hand and for a moment speech failed him . then he rose to the occasion . pleased to meet you said mr . burt . iv the mystery of hunters lodge after all murmured poirot it is possible that i shall not die this time . coming from a convalescent influenza patient i hailed the remark as showing a beneficial optimism . i myself had been the first sufferer from the disease . poirot in his turn had gone down . he was now sitting up in bed propped up with pillows his head muffled in a woollen shawl and was slowly sipping a particularly noxious tisane which i had prepared according to his directions . his eye rested with pleasure upon a neatly graduated row of medicine bottles which adorned the mantelpiece . yes yes my little friend continued . once more shall i be myself again the great hercule poirot the terror of evildoers figure to yourself mon ami that i have a little paragraph to myself in society gossip . but yes here it is go itcriminalsall out hercule poirotand believe me girls hes some herculesour own pet society detective cant get a grip on you . cause why ? cause hes got la grippe himself i laughed . good for you poirot . you are becoming quite a public character . and fortunately you havent missed anything of particular interest during this time . that is true . the few cases i have had to decline did not fill me with any regret . our landlady stuck her head in at the door . theres a gentleman downstairs . says he must see monsieur poirot or you captain . seeing as he was in a great todoand with all that quite the gentlemani brought up is card . she handed me the bit of pasteboard . mr . roger havering i read . poirot motioned with his head towards the bookcase and i obediently pulled forth whos who . poirot took it from me and scanned the pages rapidly . second son of fifth baron windsor . married  zoe fourth daughter of william crabb . hm i said . i rather fancy thats the girl who used to act at the frivolityonly she called herself zoe carrisbrook . i remember she married some young man about town just before the war . would it interest you hastings to go down and hear what our visitors particular little trouble is ? make him all my excuses . roger havering was a man of about forty well set up and of smart appearance . his face however was haggard and he was evidently labouring under great agitation . captain hastings ? you are monsieur poirots partner i understand . it is imperative that he should come with me to derbyshire today . im afraid thats impossible i replied . poirot is ill in bedinfluenza . his face fell . dear me that is a great blow to me . the matter on which you want to consult him is serious ? my god yes my uncle the best friend i have in the world was foully murdered last night . here in london ? no in derbyshire . i was in town and received a telegram from my wife this morning . immediately upon its receipt i determined to come round and beg monsieur poirot to undertake the case . if you will excuse me a minute i said struck by a sudden idea . i rushed upstairs and in a few brief words acquainted poirot with the situation . he took any further words out of my mouth . i see . i see . you want to go yourself is it not so ? well why not ? you should know my methods by now . all i ask is that you should report to me fully every day and follow implicitly any instructions i may wire you . to this i willingly agreed .        an hour later i was sitting opposite mr . havering in a firstclass carriage on the midland railway speeding rapidly away from london . to begin with captain hastings you must understand that hunters lodge where we are going and where the tragedy took place is only a small shootingbox in the heart of the derbyshire moors . our real home is near newmarket and we usually rent a flat in town for the season . hunters lodge is looked after by a housekeeper who is quite capable of doing all we need when we run down for an occasional weekend . of course during the shooting season we take down some of our own servants from newmarket . my uncle mr . harrington pace as you may know my mother was a miss pace of new york has for the last three years made his home with us . he never got on well with my father or my elder brother and i suspect that my being somewhat of a prodigal son myself rather increased than diminished his affection towards me . of course i am a poor man and my uncle was a rich onein other words he paid the piper but though exacting in many ways he was not really hard to get on with and we all three lived very harmoniously together . two days ago my uncle rather wearied with some recent gaieties of ours in town suggested that we should run down to derbyshire for a day or two . my wife telegraphed to mrs . middleton the housekeeper and we went down that same afternoon . yesterday evening i was forced to return to town but my wife and my uncle remained on . this morning i received this telegram . he handed it over to me come at once uncle harrington murdered last night bring good detective if you can but do comezoe . then as yet you know no details ? no i suppose it will be in the evening papers . without doubt the police are in charge . it was about three oclock when we arrived at the little station of elmers dale . from there a fivemile drive brought us to a small grey stone building in the midst of the rugged moors . a lonely place i observed with a shiver . havering nodded . i shall try and get rid of it . i could never live here again . we unlatched the gate and were walking up the narrow path to the oak door when a familiar figure emerged and came to meet us . japp i ejaculated . the scotland yard inspector grinned at me in a friendly fashion before addressing my companion . mr . havering i think ? ive been sent down from london to take charge of this case and id like a word with you if i may sir . my wife ive seen your good lady sirand the housekeeper . i wont keep you a moment but im anxious to get back to the village now that ive seen all there is to see here . i know nothing as yet as to what exactly said japp soothingly . but there are just one or two little points id like your opinion about all the same . captain hastings here he knows me and hell go on up to the house and tell them youre coming . what have you done with the little man by the way captain hastings ? hes ill in bed with influenza . is he now ? im sorry to hear that . rather the case of the cart without the horse your being here without him isnt it ? and on his rather illtimed jest i went on to the house . i rang the bell as japp had closed the door behind him . after some moments it was opened to me by a middleaged woman in black . mr . havering will be here in a moment i explained . he has been detained by the inspector . i have come down with him from london to look into the case . perhaps you can tell me briefly what occurred last night . come inside sir . she closed the door behind me and we stood in the dimlylighted hall . it was after dinner last night sir that the man came . he asked to see mr . pace sir and seeing that he spoke the same way i thought it was an american gentleman friend of mr . paces and i showed him into the gunroom and then went to tell mr . pace . he wouldnt give any name which of course was a bit odd now i come to think of it . i told mr . pace and he seemed puzzled like but he said to the mistress excuse me zoe while i just see what this fellow wants . he went off to the gunroom and i went back to the kitchen but after a while i heard loud voices as if they were quarrelling and i came out into the hall . at the same time the mistress she comes out too and just then there was a shot and then a dreadful silence . we both ran to the gunroom door but it was locked and we had to go round to the window . it was open and there inside was mr . pace all shot and bleeding . what became of the man ? he must have got away through the window sir before we got to it . and then ? mrs . havering sent me to fetch the police . five miles to walk it was . they came back with me and the constable he stayed all night and this morning the police gentleman from london arrived . what was this man like who called to see mr . pace ? the housekeeper reflected . he had a black beard sir and was about middleaged and had on a light overcoat . beyond the fact that he spoke like an american i didnt notice much about him . i see . now i wonder if i can see mrs . havering ? shes upstairs sir . shall i tell her ? if you please . tell her that mr . havering is outside with inspector japp and that the gentleman he has brought back with him from london is anxious to speak to her as soon as possible . very good sir . i was in a fever of impatience to get at all the facts . japp had two or three hours start of me and his anxiety to be gone made me keen to be close at his heels . mrs . havering did not keep me waiting long . in a few minutes i heard a light step descending the stairs and looked up to see a very handsome young woman coming towards me . she wore a flamecoloured jumper that set off the slender boyishness of her figure . on her dark head was a little hat of flamecoloured leather . even the present tragedy could not dim the vitality of her personality . i introduced myself and she nodded in quick comprehension . of course i have often heard of you and your colleague monsieur poirot . you have done some wonderful things together havent you ? it was very clever of my husband to get you so promptly . now will you ask me questions ? that is the easiest way isnt it of getting to know all you want to about this dreadful affair ? thank you mrs . havering . now what time was it that this man arrived ? it must have been just before nine oclock . we had finished dinner and were sitting over our coffee and cigarettes . your husband had already left for london ? yes he went up by the  . . did he go by car to the station or did he walk ? our own car isnt down here . one came out from the garage in elmers dale to fetch him in time for the train . was mr . pace quite his usual self ? absolutely . most normal in every way . now can you describe this visitor at all ? im afraid not . i didnt see him . mrs . middleton showed him straight into the gunroom and then came to tell my uncle . what did your uncle say ? he seemed rather annoyed but went off at once . it was about five minutes later that i heard the sound of raised voices . i ran out into the hall and almost collided with mrs . middleton . then we heard the shot . the gunroom door was locked on the inside and we had to go right round the house to the window . of course that took some time and the murderer had been able to get well away . my poor uncleher voice falteredhad been shot through the head . i saw at once that he was dead . i sent mrs . middleton for the police . i was careful to touch nothing in the room but to leave it exactly as i found it . i nodded approval . now as to the weapon ? well i can make a guess at it captain hastings . a pair of revolvers of my husbands were mounted upon the wall . one of them is missing . i pointed this out to the police and they took the other one away with them . when they have extracted the bullet i suppose they will know for certain . may i go to the gunroom ? certainly . the police have finished with it . but the body has been removed . she accompanied me to the scene of the crime . at that moment havering entered the hall and with a quick apology his wife ran to him . i was left to undertake my investigations alone . i may as well confess at once that they were rather disappointing . in detective novels clues abound but here i could find nothing that struck me as out of the ordinary except a large bloodstain on the carpet where i judged the dead man had fallen . i examined everything with painstaking care and took a couple of pictures of the room with my little camera which i had brought with me . i also examined the ground outside the window but it appeared to have been so heavily trampled underfoot that i judged it was useless to waste time over it . no i had seen all that hunters lodge had to show me . i must go back to elmers dale and get into touch with japp . accordingly i took leave of the haverings and was driven off in the car that had brought us up from the station . i found japp at the matlock arms and he took me forthwith to see the body . harrington pace was a small spare cleanshaven man typically american in appearance . he had been shot through the back of the head and the revolver had been discharged at close quarters . turned away for a moment remarked japp and the other fellow snatched up a revolver and shot him . the one mrs . havering handed over to us was fully loaded and i suppose the other one was also . curious what darn fool things people do . fancy keeping two loaded revolvers hanging up on your wall . what do you think of the case ? i asked as we left the gruesome chamber behind us . well id got my eye on havering to begin with . oh yes noting my exclamation of astonishment . havering has one or two shady incidents in his past . when he was a boy at oxford there was some funny business about the signature on one of his fathers cheques . all hushed up of course . then hes pretty heavily in debt now and theyre the kind of debts he wouldnt like to go to his uncle about whereas you may be sure the uncles will would be in his favour . yes id got my eye on him and thats why i wanted to speak to him before he saw his wife but their statements dovetail all right and ive been to the station and theres no doubt whatever that he left by the  . . that gets up to london about  . . he went straight to his club he says and if thats confirmed all rightwhy he couldnt have been shooting his uncle here at nine oclock in a black beard ah yes i was going to ask you what you thought about that beard ? japp winked . i think it grew pretty fastgrew in the five miles from elmers dale to hunters lodge . americans that ive met are mostly cleanshaven . yes its amongst mr . paces american associates that well have to look for the murderer . i questioned the housekeeper first and then her mistress and their stories agree all right but im sorry mrs . havering didnt get a look at the fellow . shes a smart woman and she might have noticed something that would set us on the track . i sat down and wrote a minute and lengthy account to poirot . i was able to add various further items of information before i posted the letter . the bullet had been extracted and was proved to have been fired from a revolver identical with the one held by the police . furthermore mr . haverings movements on the night in question had been checked and verified and it was proved beyond doubt that he had actually arrived in london by the train in question . and thirdly a sensational development had occurred . a city gentleman living at ealing on crossing haven green to get to the district railway station that morning had observed a brownpaper parcel stuck between the railings . opening it he found that it contained a revolver . he handed the parcel over to the local police station and before night it was proved to be the one we were in search of the fellow to that given us by mrs . havering . one bullet had been fired from it . all this i added to my report . a wire from poirot arrived whilst i was at breakfast the following morning of course black bearded man was not havering only you or japp would have such an idea wire me description of housekeeper and what clothes she wore this morning same of mrs . havering do not waste time taking photographs of interiors they are underexposed and not in the least artistic . it seemed to me that poirots style was unnecessarily facetious . i also fancied he was a shade jealous of my position on the spot with full facilities for handling the case . his request for a description of the clothes worn by the two women appeared to me to be simply ridiculous but i complied as well as i a mere man was able to . at eleven a reply wire came from poirot advise japp arrest housekeeper before it is too late . dumbfounded i took the wire to japp . he swore softly under his breath . hes the goods monsieur poirot if he says so theres something in it . and i hardly noticed the woman . i dont know that i can go so far as arresting her but ill have her watched . well go up right away and take another look at her . but it was too late . mrs . middleton that quiet middleaged woman who had appeared so normal and respectable had vanished into thin air . her box had been left behind . it contained only ordinary wearing apparel . there was no clue in it to her identity or as to her whereabouts . from mrs . havering we elicited all the facts we could i engaged her about three weeks ago when mrs . emery our former housekeeper left . she came to me from mrs . selbournes agency in mount streeta very wellknown place . i get all my servants from there . they sent several women to see me but this mrs . middleton seemed much the nicest and had splendid references . i engaged her on the spot and notified the agency of the fact . i cant believe that there was anything wrong with her . she was such a nice quiet woman . the thing was certainly a mystery . whilst it was clear that the woman herself could not have committed the crime since at the moment the shot was fired mrs . havering was with her in the hall nevertheless she must have some connection with the murder or why should she suddenly take to her heels and bolt ? i wired the latest development to poirot and suggested returning to london and making inquiries at selbournes agency . poirots reply was prompt useless to inquire at agency they will never have heard of her find out what vehicle took her up to hunters lodge when she first arrived there . though mystified i was obedient . the means of transport in elmers dale were limited . the local garage had two battered ford cars and there were two station flies . none of these had been requisitioned on the date in question . questioned mrs . havering explained that she had given the woman the money for her fare down to derbyshire and sufficient to hire a car or fly to take her up to hunters lodge . there was usually one of the fords at the station on the chance of its being required . taking into consideration the further fact that nobody at the station had noticed the arrival of a stranger blackbearded or otherwise on the fatal evening everything seemed to point to the conclusion that the murderer had come to the spot in a car which had been waiting near at hand to aid his escape and that the same car had brought the mysterious housekeeper to her new post . i may mention that inquiries at the agency in london bore out poirots prognostication . no such woman as mrs . middleton had ever been on their books . they had received the hon . mrs . haverings application for a housekeeper and had sent her various applicants for the post . when she sent them the engagement fee she omitted to mention which woman she had selected . somewhat crestfallen i returned to london . i found poirot established in an armchair by the fire in a garish silk dressinggown . he greeted me with much affection . mon ami hastings but how glad i am to see you . veritably i have for you a great affection . and you have enjoyed yourself ? you have run to and fro with the good japp ? you have interrogated and investigated to your hearts content ? poirot i cried the things a dark mystery it will never be solved . it is true that we are not likely to cover ourselves with glory over it . no indeed . its a hard nut to crack . oh as far as that goes i am very good at cracking the nuts a veritable squirrel it is not that which embarrasses me . i know well enough who killed mr . harrington pace . you know ? how did you find out ? your illuminating answers to my wires supplied me with the truth . see here hastings let us examine the facts methodically and in order . mr . harrington pace is a man with a considerable fortune which at his death will doubtless pass to his nephew . point no .  . his nephew is known to be desperately hard up . point no .  . his nephew is also known to beshall we say a man of rather loose moral fibre ? point no .  . but roger havering is proved to have journeyed straight up to london . prcismentand therefore as mr . havering left elmers dale at  . and since mr . pace cannot have been killed before he left or the doctor would have spotted the time of the crime as being given wrongly when he examined the body we conclude quite rightly that mr . havering did not shoot his uncle . but there is a mrs . havering hastings . impossible the housekeeper was with her when the shot was fired . ah yes the housekeeper . but she has disappeared . she will be found . i think not . there is something peculiarly elusive about that housekeeper dont you think so hastings ? it struck me at once . she played her part i suppose and then got out in the nick of time . and what was her part ? well presumably to admit her confederate the blackbearded man . oh no that was not her part her part was what you have just mentioned to provide an alibi for mrs . havering at the moment the shot was fired . and no one will ever find her mon ami because she does not exist theres no sech person as your so great shakespeare says . it was dickens i murmured unable to suppress a smile . but what do you mean poirot ? i mean that zoe havering was an actress before her marriage that you and japp only saw the housekeeper in a dark hall a dim middleaged figure in black with a faint subdued voice and finally that neither you nor japp nor the local police whom the housekeeper fetched ever saw mrs . middleton and her mistress at one and the same time . it was childs play for that clever and daring woman . on the pretext of summoning her mistress she runs upstairs slips on a bright jumper and a hat with black curls attached which she jams down over the grey transformation . a few deft touches and the makeup is removed a slight dusting of rouge and the brilliant zoe havering comes down with her clear ringing voice . nobody looks particularly at the housekeeper . why should they ? there is nothing to connect her with the crime . she too has an alibi . but the revolver that was found at ealing ? mrs . havering could not have placed it there ? no that was roger haverings jobbut it was a mistake on their part . it put me on the right track . a man who has committed a murder with a revolver which he found on the spot would fling it away at once he would not carry it up to london with him . no the motive was clear the criminals wished to focus the interest of the police on a spot far removed from derbyshire they were anxious to get the police away as soon as possible from the vicinity of hunters lodge . of course the revolver found at ealing was not the one with which mr . pace was shot . roger havering discharged one shot from it brought it up to london went straight to his club to establish his alibi then went quickly out to ealing by the district a matter of about twenty minutes only placed the parcel where it was found and so back to town . that charming creature his wife quietly shoots mr . pace after dinneryou remember he was shot from behind ? another significant point thatreloads the revolver and puts it back in its place and then starts off with her desperate little comedy . its incredible i murmured fascinated and yet and yet it is true . bien sur my friend it is true . but to bring that precious pair to justice that is another matter . well japp must do what he cani have written him fullybut i very much fear hastings that we shall be obliged to leave them to fate or le bon dieu whichever you prefer . the wicked flourish like a green bay tree i reminded him . but at a price hastings always at a price croyezmoi poirots forebodings were confirmed . japp though convinced of the truth of his theory was unable to get together the necessary evidence to ensure a conviction . mr . paces huge fortune passed into the hands of his murderers . nevertheless nemesis did overtake them and when i read in the paper that the hon . roger and mrs . havering were amongst those killed in the crashing of the air mail to paris i knew that justice was satisfied . v the million dollar bond robbery what a number of bond robberies there have been lately i observed one morning laying aside the newspaper . poirot let us forsake the science of detection and take to crime instead you are on thehow do you say it ?getrichquick tack eh mon ami ? well look at this last coup the million dollars worth of liberty bonds which the london and scottish bank were sending to new york and which disappeared in such a remarkable manner on board the olympia . if it were not for the mal de mer and the difficulty of practising the so excellent method of laverguier for a longer time than the few hours of crossing the channel i should delight to voyage myself on one of these big liners murmured poirot dreamily . yes indeed i said enthusiastically . some of them must be perfect palaces the swimmingbaths the lounges the restaurant the palm courtsreally it must be hard to believe that one is on the sea . me i always know when i am on the sea said poirot sadly . and all those bagatelles that you enumerate they say nothing to me but my friend consider for a moment the geniuses that travel as it were incognito on board these floating palaces as you so justly call them one would meet the lite the haute noblesse of the criminal world i laughed . so thats the way your enthusiasm runs you would have liked to cross swords with the man who sneaked the liberty bonds ? the landlady interrupted us . a young lady as wants to see you mr . poirot . heres her card . the card bore the inscription miss esme farquhar and poirot after diving under the table to retrieve a stray crumb and putting it carefully in the wastepaperbasket nodded to the landlady to admit her . in another minute one of the most charming girls i have ever seen was ushered into the room . she was perhaps about fiveandtwenty with big brown eyes and a perfect figure . she was welldressed and perfectly composed in manner . sit down i beg of you mademoiselle . this is my friend captain hastings who aids me in my little problems . i am afraid it is a big problem i have brought you today monsieur poirot said the girl giving me a pleasant bow as she seated herself . i dare say you have read about it in the papers . i am referring to the theft of liberty bonds on the olympia . some astonishment must have shown itself in poirots face for she continued quickly you are doubtless asking yourself what i have to do with a grave institution like the london and scottish bank . in one sense nothing in another sense everything . you see monsieur poirot i am engaged to mr . philip ridgeway . aha and mr . philip ridgeway was in charge of the bonds when they were stolen . of course no actual blame can attach to him it was not his fault in any way . nevertheless he is half distraught over the matter and his uncle i know insists that he must carelessly have mentioned having them in his possession . it is a terrible setback in his career . who is his uncle ? mr . vavasour joint general manager of the london and scottish bank . suppose miss farquhar that you recount to me the whole story ? very well . as you know the bank wished to extend their credits in america and for this purpose decided to send over a million dollars in liberty bonds . mr . vavasour selected his nephew who had occupied a position of trust in the bank for many years and who was conversant with all the details of the banks dealings in new york to make the trip . the olympia sailed from liverpool on the rd and the bonds were handed over to philip on the morning of that day by mr . vavasour and mr . shaw the two joint general managers of the london and scottish bank . they were counted enclosed in a package and sealed in his presence and he then locked the package at once in his portmanteau . a portmanteau with an ordinary lock ? no mr . shaw insisted on a special lock being fitted to it by hubbss . philip as i say placed the package at the bottom of the trunk . it was stolen just a few hours before reaching new york . a rigorous search of the whole ship was made but without result . the bonds seemed literally to have vanished into thin air . poirot made a grimace . but they did not vanish absolutely since i gather that they were sold in small parcels within half an hour of the docking of the olympia well undoubtedly the next thing is for me to see mr . ridgeway . i was about to suggest that you should lunch with me at the cheshire cheese . philip will be there . he is meeting me but does not yet know that i have been consulting you on his behalf . we agreed to this suggestion readily enough and drove there in a taxi . mr . philip ridgeway was there before us and looked somewhat surprised to see his fiance arriving with two complete strangers . he was a nicelooking young fellow tall and spruce with a touch of greying hair at the temples though he could not have been much over thirty . miss farquhar went up to him and laid her hand on his arm . you must forgive my acting without consulting you philip she said . let me introduce you to monsieur hercule poirot of whom you must often have heard and his friend captain hastings . ridgeway looked very astonished . of course i have heard of you monsieur poirot he said as he shook hands . but i had no idea that esme was thinking of consulting you about myour trouble . i was afraid you would not let me do it philip said miss farquhar meekly . so you took care to be on the safe side he observed with a smile . i hope monsieur poirot will be able to throw some light on this extraordinary puzzle for i confess frankly that i am nearly out of my mind with worry and anxiety about it . indeed his face looked drawn and haggard and showed only too clearly the strain under which he was labouring . well well said poirot . let us lunch and over lunch we will put our heads together and see what can be done . i want to hear mr . ridgeways story from his own lips . whilst we discussed the excellent steak and kidney pudding of the establishment philip ridgeway narrated the circumstances leading to the disappearance of the bonds . his story agreed with that of miss farquhar in every particular . when he had finished poirot took up the thread with a question . what exactly led you to discover that the bonds had been stolen mr . ridgeway ? he laughed rather bitterly . the thing stared me in the face monsieur poirot . i couldnt have missed it . my cabin trunk was half out from under the bunk and all scratched and cut about where theyd tried to force the lock . but i understood that it had been opened with a key ? thats so . they tried to force it but couldnt . and in the end they must have got it unlocked somehow or other . curious said poirot his eyes beginning to flicker with the green light i knew so well . very curious they waste much much time trying to prise it open and thensapristi they find that they have the key all the timefor each of hubbss locks are unique . thats just why they couldnt have had the key . it never left me day or night . you are sure of that ? i can swear to it and besides if they had had the key or a duplicate why should they waste time trying to force an obviously unforceable lock ? ah there is exactly the question we are asking ourselves i venture to prophesy that the solution if we ever find it will hinge on that curious fact . i beg of you not to assault me if i ask you one more question are you perfectly certain you did not leave the trunk unlocked ? philip ridgeway merely looked at him and poirot gesticulated apologetically . ah but these things can happen i assure you very well the bonds were stolen from the trunk . what did the thief do with them ? how did he manage to get ashore with them ? ah cried ridgeway . thats just it . how ? word was passed to the customs authorities and every soul that left the ship was gone over with a toothcomb and the bonds i gather made a bulky package ? certainly they did . they could hardly have been hidden on boardand anyway we know they werent because they were offered for sale within half an hour of the olympias arrival long before i got the cables going and the numbers sent out . one broker swears he bought some of them even before the olympia got in . but you cant send bonds by wireless . not by wireless but did any tug come alongside ? only the official ones and that was after the alarm was given when every one was on the lookout . i was watching out myself for their being passed over to some one that way . my god monsieur poirot this thing will drive me mad people are beginning to say i stole them myself . but you also were searched on landing werent you ? asked poirot gently . yes . the young man stared at him in a puzzled manner . you do not catch my meaning i see said poirot smiling enigmatically . now i should like to make a few inquiries at the bank . ridgeway produced a card and scribbled a few words on it . send this in and my uncle will see you at once . poirot thanked him bade farewell to miss farquhar and together we started out for threadneedle street and the head office of the london and scottish bank . on production of ridgeways card we were led through the labyrinth of counters and desks skirting payingin clerks and payingout clerks and up to a small office on the first floor where the joint general managers received us . they were two grave gentlemen who had grown grey in the service of the bank . mr . vavasour had a short white beard mr . shaw was clean shaven . i understand you are strictly a private inquiry agent ? said mr . vavasour . quite so quite so . we have of course placed ourselves in the hands of scotland yard . inspector mcneil has charge of the case . a very able officer i believe . i am sure of it said poirot politely . you will permit a few questions on your nephews behalf ? about this lock who ordered it from hubbss ? i ordered it myself said mr . shaw . i would not trust to any clerk in the matter . as to the keys mr . ridgeway had one and the other two are held by my colleague and myself . and no clerk has had access to them ? mr . shaw turned inquiringly to mr . vavasour . i think i am correct in saying that they have remained in the safe where we placed them on the rd said mr . vavasour . my colleague was unfortunately taken ill a fortnight agoin fact on the very day that philip left us . he has only just recovered . severe bronchitis is no joke to a man of my age said mr . shaw ruefully . but i am afraid mr . vavasour has suffered from the hard work entailed by my absence especially with this unexpected worry coming on top of everything . poirot asked a few more questions . i judged that he was endeavouring to gauge the exact amount of intimacy between uncle and nephew . mr . vavasours answers were brief and punctilious . his nephew was a trusted official of the bank and had no debts or money difficulties that he knew of . he had been entrusted with similar missions in the past . finally we were politely bowed out . i am disappointed said poirot as we emerged into the street . you hoped to discover more ? they are such stodgy old men . it is not their stodginess which disappoints me mon ami . i do not expect to find in a bank manager a keen financier with an eagle glance as your favourite works of fiction put it . no i am disappointed in the caseit is too easy easy ? yes do you not find it almost childishly simple ? you know who stole the bonds ? i do . but thenwe mustwhy do not confuse and fluster yourself hastings . we are not going to do anything at present . but why ? what are you waiting for ? for the olympia . she is due on her return trip from new york on tuesday . but if you know who stole the bonds why wait ? he may escape . to a south sea island where there is no extradition ? no mon ami he would find life very uncongenial there . as to why i waiteh bien to the intelligence of hercule poirot the case is perfectly clear but for the benefit of others not so greatly gifted by the good godthe inspector mcneil for instanceit would be as well to make a few inquiries to establish the facts . one must have consideration for those less gifted than oneself . good lord poirot do you know id give a considerable sum of money to see you make a thorough ass of yourselfjust for once . youre so confoundedly conceited do not enrage yourself hastings . in verity i observe that there are times when you almost detest me alas i suffer the penalties of greatness the little man puffed out his chest and sighed so comically that i was forced to laugh . tuesday saw us speeding to liverpool in a firstclass carriage of the l .  n .w .r . poirot had obstinately refused to enlighten me as to his suspicionsor certainties . he contented himself with expressing surprise that i too was not equally au fait with the situation . i disdained to argue and entrenched my curiosity behind a rampart of pretended indifference . once arrived at the quay alongside which lay the big transatlantic liner poirot became brisk and alert . our proceedings consisted in interviewing four successive stewards and inquiring after a friend of poirots who had crossed to new york on the rd . an elderly gentleman wearing glasses . a great invalid hardly moved out of his cabin . the description appeared to tally with one mr . ventnor who had occupied the cabin c  which was next to that of philip ridgeway . although unable to see how poirot had deduced mr . ventnors existence and personal appearance i was keenly excited . tell me i cried was this gentleman one of the first to land when you got to new york ? the steward shook his head . no indeed sir he was one of the last off the boat . i retired crestfallen and observed poirot grinning at me . he thanked the steward a note changed hands and we took our departure . its all very well i remarked heatedly but that last answer must have damped your precious theory grin as you please as usual you see nothing hastings . that last answer is on the contrary the copingstone of my theory . i flung up my hands in despair . i give it up .        when we were in the train speeding towards london poirot wrote busily for a few minutes sealing up the result in an envelope . this is for the good inspector mcneil . we will leave it at scotland yard in passing and then to the rendezvous restaurant where i have asked miss esme farquhar to do us the honour of dining with us . what about ridgeway ? what about him ? asked poirot with a twinkle . why you surely dont thinkyou cant the habit of incoherence is growing upon you hastings . as a matter of fact i did think . if ridgeway had been the thiefwhich was perfectly possiblethe case would have been charming a piece of neat methodical work . but not so charming for miss farquhar . possibly you are right . therefore all is for the best . now hastings let us review the case . i can see that you are dying to do so . the sealed package is removed from the trunk and vanishes as miss farquhar puts it into thin air . we will dismiss the thin air theory which is not practicable at the present stage of science and consider what is likely to have become of it . every one asserts the incredibility of its being smuggled ashore yes but we know you may know hastings . i do not . i take the view that since it seemed incredible it was incredible . two possibilities remain it was hidden on boardalso rather difficultor it was thrown overboard . with a cork on it do you mean ? without a cork . i stared . but if the bonds were thrown overboard they couldnt have been sold in new york . i admire your logical mind hastings . the bonds were sold in new york therefore they were not thrown overboard . you see where that leads us ? where we were when we started . jamais de la vie if the package was thrown overboard and the bonds were sold in new york the package could not have contained the bonds . is there any evidence that the package did contain the bonds ? remember mr . ridgeway never opened it from the time it was placed in his hands in london . yes but then poirot waved an impatient hand . permit me to continue . the last moment that the bonds are seen as bonds is in the office of the london and scottish bank on the morning of the rd . they reappear in new york half an hour after the olympia gets in and according to one man whom nobody listens to actually before she gets in . supposing then that they have never been on the olympia at all ? is there any other way they could get to new york ? yes . the gigantic leaves southampton on the same day as the olympia and she holds the record for the atlantic . mailed by the gigantic the bonds would be in new york the day before the olympia arrived . all is clear the case begins to explain itself . the sealed packet is only a dummy and the moment of its substitution must be in the office in the bank . it would be an easy matter for any of the three men present to have prepared a duplicate package which could be substituted for the genuine one . trs bien the bonds are mailed to a confederate in new york with instructions to sell as soon as the olympia is in but some one must travel on the olympia to engineer the supposed moment of the robbery . but why ? because if ridgeway merely opens the packet and finds it a dummy suspicion flies at once to london . no the man on board in the cabin next door does his work pretends to force the lock in an obvious manner so as to draw immediate attention to the theft really unlocks the trunk with a duplicate key throws the package overboard and waits until the last to leave the boat . naturally he wears glasses to conceal his eyes and is an invalid since he does not want to run the risk of meeting ridgeway . he steps ashore in new york and returns by the first boat available . but whowhich was he ? the man who had a duplicate key the man who ordered the lock the man who has not been severely ill with bronchitis at his home in the countryenfin that stodgy old man mr . shaw there are criminals in high places sometimes my friend . ah here we are . mademoiselle i have succeeded you permit ? and beaming poirot kissed the astonished girl lightly on either cheek vi the adventure of the egyptian tomb i have always considered that one of the most thrilling and dramatic of the many adventures i have shared with poirot was that of our investigation into the strange series of deaths which followed upon the discovery and opening of the tomb of king menherra . hard upon the discovery of the tomb of tutankhamen by lord carnarvon sir john willard and mr . bleibner of new york pursuing their excavations not far from cairo in the vicinity of the pyramids of gizeh came unexpectedly on a series of funeral chambers . the greatest interest was aroused by their discovery . the tomb appeared to be that of king menherra one of those shadowy kings of the eighth dynasty when the old kingdom was falling to decay . little was known about this period and the discoveries were fully reported in the newspapers . an event soon occurred which took a profound hold on the public mind . sir john willard died quite suddenly of heart failure . the more sensational newspapers immediately took the opportunity of reviving all the old superstitious stories connected with the ill luck of certain egyptian treasures . the unlucky mummy at the british museum that hoary old chestnut was dragged out with fresh zest was quietly denied by the museum but nevertheless enjoyed all its usual vogue . a fortnight later mr . bleibner died of acute blood poisoning and a few days afterwards a nephew of his shot himself in new york . the curse of menherra was the talk of the day and the magic power of dead and gone egypt was exalted to a fetish point . it was then that poirot received a brief note from lady willard widow of the dead archaeologist asking him to go and see her at her house in kensington square . i accompanied him . lady willard was a tall thin woman dressed in deep mourning . her haggard face bore eloquent testimony to her recent grief . it is kind of you to have come so promptly monsieur poirot . i am at your service lady willard . you wished to consult me ? you are i am aware a detective but it is not only as a detective that i wish to consult you . you are a man of original views i know you have imagination experience of the world tell me monsieur poirot what are your views on the supernatural ? poirot hesitated for a moment before he replied . he seemed to be considering . finally he said let us not misunderstand each other lady willard . it is not a general question that you are asking me there . it has a personal application has it not ? you are referring obliquely to the death of your late husband ? that is so she admitted . you want me to investigate the circumstances of his death ? i want you to ascertain for me exactly how much is newspaper chatter and how much may be said to be founded on fact ? three deaths monsieur poiroteach one explicable taken by itself but taken together surely an almost unbelievable coincidence and all within a month of the opening of the tomb it may be mere superstition it may be some potent curse from the past that operates in ways undreamed of by modern science . the fact remainsthree deaths and i am afraid monsieur poirot horribly afraid . it may not yet be the end . for whom do you fear ? for my son . when the news of my husbands death came i was ill . my son who has just come down from oxford went out there . he brought thethe body home but now he has gone out again in spite of my prayers and entreaties . he is so fascinated by the work that he intends to take his fathers place and carry on the system of excavations . you may think me a foolish credulous woman but monsieur poirot i am afraid . supposing that the spirit of the dead king is not yet appeased ? perhaps to you i seem to be talking nonsense no indeed lady willard said poirot quickly . i too believe in the force of superstition one of the greatest forces the world has ever known . i looked at him in surprise . i should never have credited poirot with being superstitious . but the little man was obviously in earnest . what you really demand is that i shall protect your son ? i will do my utmost to keep him from harm . yes in the ordinary way but against an occult influence ? in volumes of the middle ages lady willard you will find many ways of counteracting black magic . perhaps they knew more than we moderns with all our boasted science . now let us come to facts that i may have guidance . your husband had always been a devoted egyptologist hadnt he ? yes from his youth upwards . he was one of the greatest living authorities upon the subject . but mr . bleibner i understand was more or less of an amateur ? oh quite . he was a very wealthy man who dabbled freely in any subject that happened to take his fancy . my husband managed to interest him in egyptology and it was his money that was so useful in financing the expedition . and the nephew ? what do you know of his tastes ? was he with the party at all ? i do not think so . in fact i never knew of his existence till i read of his death in the paper i do not think he and mr . bleibner can have been at all intimate . he never spoke of having any relations . who are the other members of the party ? well there is dr . tosswill a minor official connected with the british museum mr . schneider of the metropolitan museum in new york a young american secretary dr . ames who accompanies the expedition in his professional capacity and hassan my husbands devoted native servant . do you remember the name of the american secretary ? harper i think but i cannot be sure . he had not been with mr . bleibner very long i know . he was a very pleasant young fellow . thank you lady willard . if there is anything else ? for the moment nothing . leave it now in my hands and be assured that i will do all that is humanly possible to protect your son . they were not exactly reassuring words and i observed lady willard wince as he uttered them . yet at the same time the fact that he had not poohpoohed her fears seemed in itself to be a relief to her . for my part i had never before suspected that poirot had so deep a vein of superstition in his nature . i tackled him on the subject as we went homewards . his manner was grave and earnest . but yes hastings . i believe in these things . you must not underrate the force of superstition . what are we going to do about it ? toujours pratique the good hastings eh bien to begin with we are going to cable to new york for fuller details of young mr . bleibners death . he duly sent off his cable . the reply was full and precise . young rupert bleibner had been in low water for several years . he had been a beachcomber and a remittance man in several south sea islands but had returned to new york two years ago where he had rapidly sunk lower and lower . the most significant thing to my mind was that he had recently managed to borrow enough money to take him to egypt . ive a good friend there i can borrow from he had declared . here however his plans had gone awry . he had returned to new york cursing his skinflint of an uncle who cared more for the bones of dead and gone kings than his own flesh and blood . it was during his sojourn in egypt that the death of sir john willard occurred . rupert had plunged once more into his life of dissipation in new york and then without warning he had committed suicide leaving behind him a letter which contained some curious phrases . it seemed written in a sudden fit of remorse . he referred to himself as a leper and an outcast and the letter ended by declaring that such as he were better dead . a shadowy theory leapt into my brain . i had never really believed in the vengeance of a long dead egyptian king . i saw here a more modern crime . supposing this young man had decided to do away with his unclepreferably by poison . by mistake sir john willard receives the fatal dose . the young man returns to new york haunted by his crime . the news of his uncles death reaches him . he realizes how unnecessary his crime has been and stricken with remorse takes his own life . i outlined my solution to poirot . he was interested . it is ingenious what you have thought of theredecidedly it is ingenious . it may even be true . but you leave out of count the fatal influence of the tomb . i shrugged my shoulders . you still think that has something to do with it ? so much so mon ami that we start for egypt tomorrow . what ? i cried astonished . i have said it . an expression of conscious heroism spread over poirots face . then he groaned . but oh he lamented the sea the hateful sea        it was a week later . beneath our feet was the golden sand of the desert . the hot sun poured down overhead . poirot the picture of misery wilted by my side . the little man was not a good traveller . our four days voyage from marseilles had been one long agony to him . he had landed at alexandria the wraith of his former self even his usual neatness had deserted him . we had arrived in cairo and had driven out at once to the mena house hotel right in the shadow of the pyramids . the charm of egypt had laid hold of me . not so poirot . dressed precisely the same as in london he carried a small clothesbrush in his pocket and waged an unceasing war on the dust which accumulated on his dark apparel . and my boots he wailed . regard them hastings . my boots of the neat patent leather usually so smart and shining . see the sand is inside them which is painful and outside them which outrages the eyesight . also the heat it causes my moustaches to become limpbut limp look at the sphinx i urged . even i can feel the mystery and the charm it exhales . poirot looked at it discontentedly . it has not the air happy he declared . how could it halfburied in sand in that untidy fashion . ah this cursed sand come now theres a lot of sand in belgium i reminded him mindful of a holiday spent at knockesurmer in the midst of les dunes impeccables as the guidebook had phrased it . not in brussels declared poirot . he gazed at the pyramids thoughtfully . it is true that they at least are of a shape solid and geometrical but their surface is of an unevenness most unpleasing . and the palmtrees i like them not . not even do they plant them in rows i cut short his lamentations by suggesting that we should start for the camp . we were to ride there on camels and the beasts were patiently kneeling waiting for us to mount in charge of several picturesque boys headed by a voluble dragoman . i pass over the spectacle of poirot on a camel . he started by groans and lamentations and ended by shrieks gesticulations and invocations to the virgin mary and every saint in the calendar . in the end he descended ignominiously and finished the journey on a diminutive donkey . i must admit that a trotting camel is no joke for the amateur . i was stiff for several days . at last we neared the scene of the excavations . a sunburnt man with a grey beard in white clothes and wearing a helmet came to meet us . monsieur poirot and captain hastings ? we received your cable . im sorry that there was no one to meet you in cairo . an unforeseen event occurred which completely disorganized our plans . poirot paled . his hand which had stolen to his clothesbrush stayed its course . not another death ? he breathed . yes . sir guy willard ? i cried . no captain hastings . my american colleague mr . schneider . and the cause ? demanded poirot . tetanus . i blanched . all around me i seemed to feel an atmosphere of evil subtle and menacing . a horrible thought flashed across me . supposing i were the next ? mon dieu said poirot in a very low voice i do not understand this . it is horrible . tell me monsieur there is no doubt that it was tetanus ? i believe not . but dr . ames will tell you more than i can do . ah of course you are not the doctor . my name is tosswill . this then was the british expert described by lady willard as being a minor official at the british museum . there was something at once grave and steadfast about him that took my fancy . if you will come with me continued dr . tosswill i will take you to sir guy willard . he was most anxious to be informed as soon as you should arrive . we were taken across the camp to a large tent . dr . tosswill lifted up the flap and we entered . three men were sitting inside . monsieur poirot and captain hastings have arrived sir guy said tosswill . the youngest of the three men jumped up and came forward to greet us . there was a certain impulsiveness in his manner which reminded me of his mother . he was not nearly so sunburnt as the others and that fact coupled with a certain haggardness round the eyes made him look older than his twentytwo years . he was clearly endeavouring to bear up under a severe mental strain . he introduced his two companions dr . ames a capable looking man of thirty odd with a touch of greying hair at the temples and mr . harper the secretary a pleasant lean young man wearing the national insignia of hornrimmed spectacles . after a few minutes desultory conversation the latter went out and dr . tosswill followed him . we were left alone with sir guy and dr . ames . please ask any questions you want to ask monsieur poirot said willard . we are utterly dumbfounded at this strange series of disasters but it isntit cant be anything but coincidence . there was a nervousness about his manner which rather belied the words . i saw that poirot was studying him keenly . your heart is really in this work sir guy ? rather . no matter what happens or what comes of it the work is going on . make up your mind to that . poirot wheeled round on the other . what have you to say to that monsieur le docteur ? well drawled the doctor im not for quitting myself . poirot made one of those expressive grimaces of his . then videmment we must find out just how we stand . when did mr . schneiders death take place ? three days ago . you are sure it was tetanus ? dead sure . it couldnt have been a case of strychnine poisoning for instance ? no monsieur poirot . i see what youre getting at . but it was a clear case of tetanus . did you not inject antiserum ? certainly we did said the doctor dryly . every conceivable thing that could be done was tried . had you the antiserum with you ? no . we procured it from cairo . have there been any other cases of tetanus in the camp ? no not one . are you certain that the death of mr . bleibner was not due to tetanus ? absolutely plumb certain . he had a scratch upon his thumb which became poisoned and septicmia set in . it sounds pretty much the same to a layman i dare say but the two things are entirely different . then we have four deathsall totally dissimilar one heart failure one blood poisoning one suicide and one tetanus . exactly monsieur poirot . are you certain that there is nothing which might link the four together ? i dont quite understand you ? i will put it plainly . was any act committed by those four men which might seem to denote disrespect to the spirit of menherra ? the doctor gazed at poirot in astonishment . youre talking through your hat monsieur poirot . surely youve not been guyed into believing all that fool talk ? absolute nonsense muttered willard angrily . poirot remained placidly immovable blinking a little out of his green cats eyes . so you do not believe it monsieur le docteur ? no sir i do not declared the doctor emphatically . i am a scientific man and i believe only what science teaches . was there no science then in ancient egypt ? asked poirot softly . he did not wait for a reply and indeed dr . ames seemed rather at a loss for the moment . no no do not answer me but tell me this . what do the native workmen think ? i guess said dr . ames that where white folk lose their heads natives arent going to be far behind . ill admit that theyre getting what you might call scaredbut theyve no cause to be . i wonder said poirot noncommittally . sir guy leant forward . surely he cried incredulously you cannot believe inoh but the things absurd you can know nothing of ancient egypt if you think that . for answer poirot produced a little book from his pocketan ancient tattered volume . as he held it out i saw its title the magic of the egyptians and chaldeans . then wheeling round he strode out of the tent . the doctor stared at me . what is his little idea ? the phrase so familiar on poirots lips made me smile as it came from another . i dont know exactly i confessed . hes got some plan of exorcizing the evil spirits i believe . i went in search of poirot and found him talking to the leanfaced young man who had been the late mr . bleibners secretary . no mr . harper was saying ive only been six months with the expedition . yes i knew mr . bleibners affairs pretty well . can you recount to me anything concerning his nephew ? he turned up here one day not a badlooking fellow . id never met him before but some of the others hadames i think and schneider . the old man wasnt at all pleased to see him . they were at it in no time hammer and tongs . not a cent the old man shouted . not one cent now or when im dead . i intend to leave my money to the furtherance of my lifes work . ive been talking it over with mr . schneider today . and a bit more of the same . young bleibner lit out for cairo right away . was he in perfectly good health at the time ? the old man ? no the young one . i believe he did mention there was something wrong with him . but it couldnt have been anything serious or i should have remembered . one thing more has mr . bleibner left a will ? so far as we know he has not . are you remaining with the expedition mr . harper ? no sir i am not . im for new york as soon as i can square up things here . you may laugh if you like but im not going to be this blasted old menherras next victim . hell get me if i stop here . the young man wiped the perspiration from his brow . poirot turned away . over his shoulder he said with a peculiar smile remember he got one of his victims in new york . oh hell said mr . harper forcibly . that young man is nervous said poirot thoughtfully . he is on the edge but absolutely on the edge . i glanced at poirot curiously but his enigmatical smile told me nothing . in company with sir guy willard and dr . tosswill we were taken round the excavations . the principal finds had been removed to cairo but some of the tomb furniture was extremely interesting . the enthusiasm of the young baronet was obvious but i fancied that i detected a shade of nervousness in his manner as though he could not quite escape from the feeling of menace in the air . as we entered the tent which had been assigned to us for a wash before joining the evening meal a tall dark figure in white robes stood aside to let us pass with a graceful gesture and a murmured greeting in arabic . poirot stopped . you are hassan the late sir john willards servant ? i served my lord sir john now i serve his son . he took a step nearer to us and lowered his voice . you are a wise one they say learned in dealing with evil spirits . let the young master depart from here . there is evil in the air around us . and with an abrupt gesture not waiting for a reply he strode away . evil in the air muttered poirot . yes i feel it . our meal was hardly a cheerful one . the floor was left to dr . tosswill who discoursed at length upon egyptian antiquities . just as we were preparing to retire to rest sir guy caught poirot by the arm and pointed . a shadowy figure was moving amidst the tents . it was no human one i recognized distinctly the dogheaded figure i had seen carved on the walls of the tomb . my blood literally froze at the sight . mon dieu murmured poirot crossing himself vigorously . anubis the jackalheaded the god of departing souls . some one is hoaxing us cried dr . tosswill rising indignantly to his feet . it went into your tent harper muttered sir guy his face dreadfully pale . no said poirot shaking his head into that of the dr . ames . the doctor stared at him incredulously then repeating dr . tosswills words he cried some one is hoaxing us . come well soon catch the fellow . he dashed energetically in pursuit of the shadowy apparition . i followed him but search as we would we could find no trace of any living soul having passed that way . we returned somewhat disturbed in mind to find poirot taking energetic measures in his own way to ensure his personal safety . he was busily surrounding our tent with various diagrams and inscriptions which he was drawing in the sand . i recognized the fivepointed star or pentagon many times repeated . as was his wont poirot was at the same time delivering an impromptu lecture on witchcraft and magic in general white magic as opposed to black with various references to the ka and the book of the dead thrown in . it appeared to excite the liveliest contempt in dr . tosswill who drew me aside literally snorting with rage . balderdash sir he exclaimed angrily . pure balderdash . the mans an impostor . he doesnt know the difference between the superstitions of the middle ages and the beliefs of ancient egypt . never have i heard such a hotchpotch of ignorance and credulity . i calmed the excited expert and joined poirot in the tent . my little friend was beaming cheerfully . we can now sleep in peace he declared happily . and i can do with some sleep . my head it aches abominably . ah for a good tisane as though in answer to prayer the flap of the tent was lifted and hassan appeared bearing a steaming cup which he offered to poirot . it proved to be camomile tea a beverage of which he is inordinately fond . having thanked hassan and refused his offer of another cup for myself we were left alone once more . i stood at the door of the tent some time after undressing looking out over the desert . a wonderful place i said aloud and a wonderful work . i can feel the fascination . this desert life this probing into the heart of a vanished civilization . surely poirot you too must feel the charm ? i got no answer and i turned a little annoyed . my annoyance was quickly changed to concern . poirot was lying back across the rude couch his face horribly convulsed . beside him was the empty cup . i rushed to his side then dashed out and across the camp to dr . amess tent . dr . ames i cried . come at once . whats the matter ? said the doctor appearing in pyjamas . my friend . hes ill . dying . the camomile tea . dont let hassan leave the camp . like a flash the doctor ran to our tent . poirot was lying as i left him . extraordinary cried ames . looks like a seizureorwhat did you say about something he drank ? he picked up the empty cup . only i did not drink it said a placid voice . we turned in amazement . poirot was sitting up on the bed . he was smiling . no he said gently . i did not drink it . while my good friend hastings was apostrophizing the night i took the opportunity of pouring it not down my throat but into a little bottle . that little bottle will go to the analytical chemist . noas the doctor made a sudden movementas a sensible man you will understand that violence will be of no avail . during hastings brief absence to fetch you i have had time to put the bottle in safe keeping . ah quick hastings hold him i misunderstood poirots anxiety . eager to save my friend i flung myself in front of him . but the doctors swift movement had another meaning . his hand went to his mouth a smell of bitter almonds filled the air and he swayed forward and fell . another victim said poirot gravely but the last . perhaps it is the best way . he has three deaths on his head . dr . ames ? i cried stupefied . but i thought you believed in some occult influence ? you misunderstood me hastings . what i meant was that i believe in the terrific force of superstition . once get it firmly established that a series of deaths are supernatural and you might almost stab a man in broad daylight and it would still be put down to the curse so strongly is the instinct of the supernatural implanted in the human race . i suspected from the first that a man was taking advantage of that instinct . the idea came to him i imagine with the death of sir john willard . a fury of superstition arose at once . as far as i could see nobody could derive any particular profit from sir johns death . mr . bleibner was a different case . he was a man of great wealth . the information i received from new york contained several suggestive points . to begin with young bleibner was reported to have said he had a good friend in egypt from whom he could borrow . it was tacitly understood that he meant his uncle but it seemed to me that in that case he would have said so outright . the words suggest some boon companion of his own . another thing he scraped up enough money to take him to egypt his uncle refused outright to advance him a penny yet he was able to pay the return passage to new york . some one must have lent him the money . all that was very thin i objected . but there was more . hastings there occur often enough words spoken metaphorically which are taken literally . the opposite can happen too . in this case words which were meant literally were taken metaphorically . young bleibner wrote plainly enough i am a leper but nobody realized that he shot himself because he believed that he had contracted the dread disease of leprosy . what ? i ejaculated . it was the clever invention of a diabolical mind . young bleibner was suffering from some minor skin trouble he had lived in the south sea islands where the disease is common enough . ames was a former friend of his and a wellknown medical man he would never dream of doubting his word . when i arrived here my suspicions were divided between harper and dr . ames but i soon realized that only the doctor could have perpetrated and concealed the crimes and i learnt from harper that he was previously acquainted with young bleibner . doubtless the latter at some time or another had made a will or had insured his life in favour of the doctor . the latter saw his chance of acquiring wealth . it was easy for him to inoculate mr . bleibner with the deadly germs . then the nephew overcome with despair at the dread news his friend had conveyed to him shot himself . mr . bleibner whatever his intentions had made no will . his fortune would pass to his nephew and from him to the doctor . and mr . schneider ? we cannot be sure . he knew young bleibner too remember and may have suspected something or again the doctor may have thought that a further death motiveless and purposeless would strengthen the coils of superstition . furthermore i will tell you an interesting psychological fact hastings . a murderer has always a strong desire to repeat his successful crime the performance of it grows upon him . hence my fears for young willard . the figure of anubis you saw tonight was hassan dressed up by my orders . i wanted to see if i could frighten the doctor . but it would take more than the supernatural to frighten him . i could see that he was not entirely taken in by my pretences of belief in the occult . the little comedy i played for him did not deceive him . i suspected that he would endeavour to make me the next victim . ah but in spite of la mer maudite the heat abominable and the annoyances of the sand the little grey cells still functioned poirot proved to be perfectly right in his premises . young bleibner some years ago in a fit of drunken merriment had made a jocular will leaving my cigarette case you admire so much and everything else of which i die possessed which will be principally debts to my good friend robert ames who once saved my life from drowning . the case was hushed up as far as possible and to this day people talk of the remarkable series of deaths in connection with the tomb of menherra as a triumphal proof of the vengeance of a bygone king upon the desecrators of his tomba belief which as poirot pointed out to me is contrary to all egyptian belief and thought . vii the jewel robbery at the grand metropolitan poirot i said a change of air would do you good . you think so mon ami ? i am sure of it . eheh ? said my friend smiling . it is all arranged then ? you will come ? where do you propose to take me ? brighton . as a matter of fact a friend of mine in the city put me on to a very good thing andwell i have money to burn as the saying goes . i think a weekend at the grand metropolitan would do us all the good in the world . thank you i accept most gratefully . you have the good heart to think of an old man . and the good heart it is in the end worth all the little grey cells . yes yes i who speak to you am in danger of forgetting that sometimes . i did not quite relish the implication . i fancy that poirot is sometimes a little inclined to underestimate my mental capacities . but his pleasure was so evident that i put my slight annoyance aside . then thats all right i said hastily . saturday evening saw us dining at the grand metropolitan in the midst of a gay throng . all the world and his wife seemed to be at brighton . the dresses were marvellous and the jewelsworn sometimes with more love of display than good tastewere something magnificent . hein it is a sight this murmured poirot . this is the home of the profiteer is it not so hastings ? supposed to be i replied . but well hope they arent all tarred with the profiteering brush . poirot gazed round him placidly . the sight of so many jewels makes me wish i had turned my brains to crime instead of to its detection . what a magnificent opportunity for some thief of distinction regard hastings that stout woman by the pillar . she is as you would say plastered with gems . i followed his eyes . why i exclaimed its mrs . opalsen . you know her ? slightly . her husband is a rich stockbroker who made a fortune in the recent oil boom . after dinner we ran across the opalsens in the lounge and i introduced poirot to them . we chatted for a few minutes and ended by having our coffee together . poirot said a few words in praise of some of the costlier gems displayed on the ladys ample bosom and she brightened up at once . its a perfect hobby of mine mr . poirot . i just love jewellery . ed knows my weakness and every time things go well he brings me something new . you are interested in precious stones ? i have had a good deal to do with them one time and another madame . my profession has brought me into contact with some of the most famous jewels in the world . he went on to narrate with discreet pseudonyms the story of the historic jewels of a reigning house and mrs . opalsen listened with bated breath . there now she exclaimed as he ended . if it isnt just like a play you know ive got some pearls of my own that have a history attached to them . i believe its supposed to be one of the finest necklaces in the worldthe pearls are so beautifully matched and so perfect in colour . i declare i really must run up and get it oh madame protested poirot you are too amiable . pray do not derange yourself oh but id like to show it to you . the buxom dame waddled across to the lift briskly enough . her husband who had been talking to me looked at poirot inquiringly . madame your wife is so amiable as to insist on showing me her pearl necklace explained the latter . oh the pearls opalsen smiled in a satisfied fashion . well they are worth seeing . cost a pretty penny too still the moneys there all right i could get what i paid for them any dayperhaps more . may have to too if things go on as they are now . moneys confoundedly tight in the city . all this infernal e .p .d . he rambled on launching into technicalities where i could not follow him . he was interrupted by a small pageboy who approached and murmured something in his ear . ehwhat ? ill come at once . not taken ill is she ? excuse me gentlemen . he left us abruptly . poirot leaned back and lit one of his tiny russian cigarettes . then carefully and meticulously he arranged the empty coffeecups in a neat row and beamed happily on the result . the minutes passed . the opalsens did not return . curious i remarked at length . i wonder when they will come back . poirot watched the ascending spirals of smoke and then said thoughtfully they will not come back . why ? because my friend something has happened . what sort of thing ? how do you know ? i asked curiously . poirot smiled . a few moments ago the manager came hurriedly out of his office and ran upstairs . he was much agitated . the liftboy is deep in talk with one of the pages . the liftbell has rung three times but he heeds it not . thirdly even the waiters are distrait and to make a waiter distrait poirot shook his head with an air of finality . the affair must indeed be of the first magnitude . ah it is as i thought here come the police . two men had just entered the hotelone in uniform the other in plain clothes . they spoke to a page and were immediately ushered upstairs . a few minutes later the same boy descended and came up to where we were sitting . mr . opalsens compliments and would you step upstairs . poirot sprang nimbly to his feet . one would have said that he awaited the summons . i followed with no less alacrity . the opalsens apartments were situated on the first floor . after knocking on the door the pageboy retired and we answered the summons come in a strange scene met our eyes . the room was mrs . opalsens bedroom and in the centre of it lying back in an armchair was the lady herself weeping violently . she presented an extraordinary spectacle with the tears making great furrows in the powder with which her complexion was liberally coated . mr . opalsen was striding up and down angrily . the two police officials stood in the middle of the room one with a notebook in hand . an hotel chambermaid looking frightened to death stood by the fireplace and on the other side of the room a frenchwoman obviously mrs . opalsens maid was weeping and wringing her hands with an intensity of grief that rivalled that of her mistress . into this pandemonium stepped poirot neat and smiling . immediately with an energy surprising in one of her bulk mrs . opalsen sprang from her chair towards him . there now ed may say what he likes but i believe in luck i do . it was fated i should meet you the way i did this evening and ive a feeling that if you cant get my pearls back for me nobody can . calm yourself i pray of you madame . poirot patted her hand soothingly . reassure yourself . all will be well . hercule poirot will aid you mr . opalsen turned to the police inspector . there will be no objection to myercalling in this gentleman i suppose ? none at all sir replied the man civilly but with complete indifference . perhaps now your ladys feeling better shell just let us have the facts ? mrs . opalsen looked helplessly at poirot . he led her back to her chair . seat yourself madame and recount to us the whole history without agitating yourself . thus abjured mrs . opalsen dried her eyes gingerly and began . i came upstairs after dinner to fetch my pearls for mr . poirot here to see . the chambermaid and clestine were both in the room as usual excuse me madame but what do you mean by as usual ? mr . opalsen explained . i make it a rule that no one is to come into this room unless clestine the maid is there also . the chambermaid does the room in the morning while clestine is present and comes in after dinner to turn down the beds under the same conditions otherwise she never enters the room . well as i was saying continued mrs . opalsen i came up . i went to the drawer hereshe indicated the bottom righthand drawer of the kneehole dressingtabletook out my jewelcase and unlocked it . it seemed quite as usualbut the pearls were not there the inspector had been busy with his notebook . when had you last seen them ? he asked . they were there when i went down to dinner . you are sure ? quite sure . i was uncertain whether to wear them or not but in the end i decided on the emeralds and put them back in the jewelcase . who locked up the jewelcase ? i did . i wear the key on a chain round my neck . she held it up as she spoke . the inspector examined it and shrugged his shoulders . the thief must have had a duplicate key . no difficult matter . the lock is quite a simple one . what did you do after youd locked the jewelcase ? i put it back in the bottom drawer where i always keep it . you didnt lock the drawer ? no i never do . my maid remains in the room till i come up so theres no need . the inspectors face grew graver . am i to understand that the jewels were there when you went down to dinner and that since then the maid has not left the room ? suddenly as though the horror of her own situation for the first time burst upon her clestine uttered a piercing shriek and flinging herself upon poirot poured out a torrent of incoherent french . the suggestion was infamous that she should be suspected of robbing madame the police were well known to be of a stupidity incredible but monsieur who was a frenchman a belgian interjected poirot but clestine paid no attention to the correction . monsieur would not stand by and see her falsely accused while that infamous chambermaid was allowed to go scotfree . she had never liked hera bold redfaced thinga born thief . she had said from the first that she was not honest . and had kept a sharp watch over her too when she was doing madames room let those idiots of policemen search her and if they did not find madames pearls on her it would be very surprising although this harangue was uttered in rapid and virulent french clestine had interlarded it with a wealth of gesture and the chambermaid realized at least a part of her meaning . she reddened angrily . if that foreign womans saying i took the pearls its a lie she declared heatedly . i never so much as saw them . search her screamed the other . you will find it is as i say . youre a liardo you hear ? said the chambermaid advancing upon her . stole em yourself and want to put it on me . why i was only in the room about three minutes before the lady come up and then you were sitting here the whole time as you always do like a cat watching a mouse . the inspector looked across inquiringly at clestine . is that true ? didnt you leave the room at all ? i did not actually leave her alone admitted clestine reluctantly but i went into my own room through the door here twiceonce to fetch a reel of cotton and once for my scissors . she must have done it then . you wasnt gone a minute retorted the chambermaid angrily . just popped out and in again . id be glad if the police would search me . ive nothing to be afraid of . at this moment there was a tap at the door . the inspector went to it . his face brightened when he saw who it was . ah he said . thats rather fortunate . i sent for one of our female searchers and shes just arrived . perhaps if you wouldnt mind going into the room next door . he looked at the chambermaid who stepped across the threshold with a toss of her head the searcher following her closely . the french girl had sunk sobbing into a chair . poirot was looking round the room the main features of which i have made clear by a sketch . a sketch of the bedroom adjoining maid's room and corridor . where does that door lead ? he inquired nodding his head towards the one by the window . into the next apartment i believe said the inspector . its bolted anyway on this side . poirot walked across to it tried it then drew back the bolt and tried it again . and on the other side as well he remarked . well that seems to rule out that . he walked over to the windows examining each of them in turn . and againnothing . not even a balcony outside . even if there were said the inspector impatiently i dont see how that would help us if the maid never left the room . videmment said poirot not disconcerted . as mademoiselle is positive she did not leave the room he was interrupted by the reappearance of the chambermaid and the police searcher . nothing said the latter laconically . i should hope not indeed said the chambermaid virtuously . and that french hussy ought to be ashamed of herself taking away an honest girls character there there my girl thats all right said the inspector opening the door . nobody suspects you . you go along and get on with your work . the chambermaid went unwillingly . going to search her ? she demanded pointing at clestine . yes yes he shut the door on her and turned the key . clestine accompanied the searcher into the small room in her turn . a few minutes later she also returned . nothing had been found on her . the inspectors face grew graver . im afraid ill have to ask you to come along with me all the same miss . he turned to mrs . opalsen . im sorry madam but all the evidence points that way . if shes not got them on her theyre hidden somewhere about the room . clestine uttered a piercing shriek and clung to poirots arm . the latter bent and whispered something in the girls ear . she looked up at him doubtfully . si si mon enfanti assure you it is better not to resist . then he turned to the inspector . you permit monsieur ? a little experimentpurely for my own satisfaction . depends on what it is replied the police officer noncommittally . poirot addressed clestine once more . you have told us that you went into your room to fetch a reel of cotton . whereabouts was it ? on the top of the chest of drawers monsieur . and the scissors ? they also . would it be troubling you too much mademoiselle to ask you to repeat those two actions ? you were sitting here with your work you say ? clestine sat down and then at a sign from poirot rose passed into the adjoining room took up an object from the chest of drawers and returned . poirot divided his attention between her movements and a large turnip of a watch which he held in the palm of his hand . again if you please mademoiselle . at the conclusion of the second performance he made a note in his pocketbook and returned the watch to his pocket . thank you mademoiselle . and you monsieurhe bowed to the inspectorfor your courtesy . the inspector seemed somewhat entertained by this excessive politeness . clestine departed in a flood of tears accompanied by the woman and the plainclothes official . then with a brief apology to mrs . opalsen the inspector set to work to ransack the room . he pulled out drawers opened cupboards completely unmade the bed and tapped the floor . mr . opalsen looked on sceptically . you really think you will find them ? yes sir . it stands to reason . she hadnt time to take them out of the room . the ladys discovering the robbery so soon upset her plans . no theyre here right enough . one of the two must have hidden themand its very unlikely for the chambermaid to have done so . more than unlikelyimpossible said poirot quietly . eh ? the inspector stared . poirot smiled modestly . i will demonstrate . hastings my good friend take my watch in your handwith care . it is a family heirloom just now i timed mademoiselles movementsher first absence from the room was of twelve seconds her second of fifteen . now observe my actions . madame will have the kindness to give me the key of the jewelcase . i thank you . my friend hastings will have the kindness to say go go i said . with almost incredible swiftness poirot wrenched open the drawer of the dressingtable extracted the jewelcase fitted the key in the lock opened the case selected a piece of jewellery shut and locked the case and returned it to the drawer which he pushed to again . his movements were like lightning . well mon ami ? he demanded of me breathlessly . fortysix seconds i replied . you see ? he looked round . there would not have been time for the chambermaid even to take the necklace out far less hide it . then that settles it on the maid said the inspector with satisfaction and returned to his search . he passed into the maids bedroom next door . poirot was frowning thoughtfully . suddenly he shot a question at mr . opalsen . this necklaceit was without doubt insured ? mr . opalsen looked a trifle surprised at the question . yes he said hesitatingly that is so . but what does that matter ? broke in mrs . opalsen tearfully . its my necklace i want . it was unique . no money could be the same . i comprehend madame said poirot soothingly . i comprehend perfectly . to la femme sentiment is everythingis it not so ? but monsieur who has not the so fine susceptibility will doubtless find some slight consolation in the fact . of course of course said mr . opalsen rather uncertainly . still he was interrupted by a shout of triumph from the inspector . he came in dangling something from his fingers . with a cry mrs . opalsen heaved herself up from her chair . she was a changed woman . oh oh my necklace she clasped it to her breast with both hands . we crowded round . where was it ? demanded opalsen . maids bed . in among the springs of the wire mattress . she must have stolen it and hidden it there before the chambermaid arrived on the scene . you permit madame ? said poirot gently . he took the necklace from her and examined it closely then handed it back with a bow . im afraid madam youll have to hand it over to us for the time being said the inspector . we shall want it for the charge . but it shall be returned to you as soon as possible . mr . opalsen frowned . is that necessary ? im afraid so sir . just a formality . oh let him take it ed cried his wife . id feel safer if he did . i shouldnt sleep a wink thinking some one else might try and get hold of it . that wretched girl and i would never have believed it of her . there there my dear dont take on so . i felt a gentle pressure on my arm . it was poirot . shall we slip away my friend ? i think our services are no longer needed . once outside however he hesitated and then much to my surprise he remarked i should rather like to see the room next door . the door was not locked and we entered . the room which was a large double one was unoccupied . dust lay about rather noticeably and my sensitive friend gave a characteristic grimace as he ran his finger round a rectangular mark on a table near the window . the service leaves to be desired he observed dryly . he was staring thoughtfully out of the window and seemed to have fallen into a brown study . well ? i demanded impatiently . what did we come in here for ? he started . je vous demande pardon mon ami . i wished to see if the door was really bolted on this side also . well i said glancing at the door which communicated with the room we had just left it is bolted . poirot nodded . he still seemed to be thinking . and anyway i continued what does it matter ? the case is over . i wish youd had more chance of distinguishing yourself . but it was the kind of case that even a stiffbacked idiot like that inspector couldnt go wrong over . poirot shook his head . the case is not over my friend . it will not be over until we find out who stole the pearls . but the maid did why do you say that ? why i stammered they were foundactually in her mattress . ta ta ta said poirot impatiently . those were not the pearls . what ? imitation mon ami . the statement took my breath away . poirot was smiling placidly . the good inspector obviously knows nothing of jewels . but presently there will be a fine hullabaloo come i cried dragging at his arm . where ? we must tell the opalsens at once . i think not . but that poor woman eh bien that poor woman as you call her will have a much better night believing the jewels to be safe . but the thief may escape with them as usual my friend you speak without reflection . how do you know that the pearls mrs . opalsen locked up so carefully tonight were not the false ones and that the real robbery did not take place at a much earlier date ? oh i said bewildered . exactly said poirot beaming . we start again . he led the way out of the room paused a moment as though considering and then walked down to the end of the corridor stopping outside the small den where the chambermaids and valets of the respective floors congregated . our particular chambermaid appeared to be holding a small court there and to be retailing her late experiences to an appreciative audience . she stopped in the middle of a sentence . poirot bowed with his usual politeness . excuse that i derange you but i shall be obliged if you will unlock for me the door of mr . opalsens room . the woman rose willingly and we accompanied her down the passage again . mr . opalsens room was on the other side of the corridor its door facing that of his wifes room . the chambermaid unlocked it with her passkey and we entered . as she was about to depart poirot detained her . one moment have you ever seen among the effects of mr . opalsen a card like this ? he held out a plain white card rather highly glazed and uncommon in appearance . the maid took it and scrutinized it carefully . no sir i cant say i have . but anyway the valet has most to do with the gentlemens rooms . i see . thank you . poirot took back the card . the woman departed . poirot appeared to reflect a little . then he gave a short sharp nod of the head . ring the bell i pray of you hastings . three times for the valet . i obeyed devoured with curiosity . meanwhile poirot had emptied the wastepaperbasket on the floor and was swiftly going through its contents . in a few moments the valet answered the bell . to him poirot put the same question and handed him the card to examine . but the response was the same . the valet had never seen a card of that particular quality among mr . opalsens belongings . poirot thanked him and he withdrew somewhat unwillingly with an inquisitive glance at the overturned wastepaperbasket and the litter on the floor . he could hardly have helped overhearing poirots thoughtful remark as he bundled the torn papers back again and the necklace was heavily insured .  .  .  . poirot i cried i see you see nothing my friend he replied quickly . as usual nothing at all it is incrediblebut there it is . let us return to our own apartments . we did so in silence . once there to my intense surprise poirot effected a rapid change of clothing . i go to london tonight he explained . it is imperative . what ? absolutely . the real work that of the brain ah those brave little grey cells it is done . i go to seek the confirmation . i shall find it impossible to deceive hercule poirot youll come a cropper one of these days i observed rather disgusted by his vanity . do not be enraged i beg of you mon ami . i count on you to do me a serviceof your friendship . of course i said eagerly rather ashamed of my moroseness . what is it ? the sleeve of my coat that i have taken offwill you brush it ? see you a little white powder has clung to it . you without doubt observed me run my finger round the drawer of the dressingtable ? no i didnt . you should observe my actions my friend . thus i obtained the powder on my finger and being a little overexcited i rubbed it on my sleeve an action without method which i deplorefalse to all my principles . but what was the powder ? i asked not particularly interested in poirots principles . not the poison of the borgias replied poirot with a twinkle . i see your imagination mounting . i should say it was french chalk . french chalk ? yes cabinetmakers use it to make drawers run smoothly . i laughed . you old sinner i thought you were working up to something exciting . au revoir my friend . i save myself . i fly the door shut behind him . with a smile half of derision half of affection i picked up the coat and stretched out my hand for the clothesbrush .        the next morning hearing nothing from poirot i went out for a stroll met some old friends and lunched with them at their hotel . in the afternoon we went for a spin . a punctured tyre delayed us and it was past eight when i got back to the grand metropolitan . the first sight that met my eyes was poirot looking even more diminutive than usual sandwiched between the opalsens beaming in a state of placid satisfaction . mon ami hastings he cried and sprang to meet me . embrace me my friend all has marched to a marvel luckily the embrace was merely figurativenot a thing one is always sure of with poirot . do you mean i began . just wonderful i call it said mrs . opalsen smiling all over her fat face . didnt i tell you ed that if he couldnt get back my pearls nobody would ? you did my dear you did . and you were right . i looked helplessly at poirot and he answered the glance . my friend hastings is as you say in england all at the seaside . seat yourself and i will recount to you all the affair that has so happily ended . ended ? but yes . they are arrested . who are arrested ? the chambermaid and the valet parbleu you did not suspect ? not with my parting hint about the french chalk ? you said cabinetmakers used it . certainly they doto make drawers slide easily . somebody wanted that drawer to slide in and out without any noise . who could that be ? obviously only the chambermaid . the plan was so ingenious that it did not at once leap to the eyenot even to the eye of hercule poirot . listen this was how it was done . the valet was in the empty room next door waiting . the french maid leaves the room . quick as a flash the chambermaid whips open the drawer takes out the jewelcase and slipping back the bolt passes it through the door . the valet opens it at his leisure with the duplicate key with which he has provided himself extracts the necklace and waits his time . clestine leaves the room again andpstin a flash the case is passed back again and replaced in the drawer . madame arrives the theft is discovered . the chambermaid demands to be searched with a good deal of righteous indignation and leaves the room without a stain on her character . the imitation necklace with which they have provided themselves has been concealed in the french girls bed that morning by the chambermaida master stroke a but what did you go to london for ? you remember the card ? certainly . it puzzled meand puzzles me still . i thought i hesitated delicately glancing at mr . opalsen . poirot laughed heartily . une blague for the benefit of the valet . the card was one with a specially prepared surfacefor fingerprints . i went straight to scotland yard asked for our old friend inspector japp and laid the facts before him . as i had suspected the fingerprints proved to be those of two wellknown jewel thieves who have been wanted for some time . japp came down with me the thieves were arrested and the necklace was discovered in the valets possession . a clever pair but they failed in method . have i not told you hastings at least thirtysix times that without method at least thirtysix thousand times i interrupted . but where did their method break down ? mon ami it is a good plan to take a place as chambermaid or valetbut you must not shirk your work . they left an empty room undusted and therefore when the man put down the jewelcase on the little table near the communicating door it left a square mark i remember i cried . before i was undecided . theni knew there was a moments silence . and ive got my pearls said mrs . opalsen as a sort of greek chorus . well i said id better have some dinner . poirot accompanied me . this ought to mean kudos for you i observed . pas du tout replied poirot tranquilly . japp and the local inspector will divide the credit between them . buthe tapped his pocketi have a cheque here from mr . opalsen and how say you my friend ? this weekend has not gone according to plan . shall we return here next weekendat my expense this time ? viii the kidnapped prime minister now that war and the problems of war are things of the past i think i may safely venture to reveal to the world the part which my friend poirot played in a moment of national crisis . the secret has been well guarded . not a whisper of it reached the press . but now that the need for secrecy has gone by i feel it is only just that england should know the debt it owes to my quaint little friend whose marvellous brain so ably averted a great catastrophe . one evening after dinneri will not particularize the date it suffices to say that it was at the time when peace by negotiation was the parrotcry of englands enemiesmy friend and i were sitting in his rooms . after being invalided out of the army i had been given a recruiting job and it had become my custom to drop in on poirot in the evenings after dinner and talk with him of any cases of interest that he might have on hand . i was attempting to discuss with him the sensational news of that dayno less than an attempted assassination of mr . david macadam englands prime minister . the account in the papers had evidently been carefully censored . no details were given save that the prime minister had had a marvellous escape the bullet just grazing his cheek . i considered that our police must have been shamefully careless for such an outrage to be possible . i could well understand that the german agents in england would be willing to risk much for such an achievement . fighting mac as his own party had nicknamed him had strenuously and unequivocally combated the pacifist influence which was becoming so prevalent . he was more than englands prime ministerhe was england and to have removed him from his sphere of influence would have been a crushing and paralysing blow to britain . poirot was busy mopping a grey suit with a minute sponge . never was there a dandy such as hercule poirot . neatness and order were his passion . now with the odour of benzine filling the air he was quite unable to give me his full attention . in a little minute i am with you my friend . i have all but finished . the spot of greasehe is not goodi remove himso he waved his sponge . i smiled as i lit another cigarette . anything interesting on ? i inquired after a minute or two . i assist ahow do you call it ?charlady to find her husband . a difficult affair needing the tact . for i have a little idea that when he is found he will not be pleased . what would you ? for my part i sympathize with him . he was a man of discrimination to lose himself . i laughed . at last the spot of grease he is gone i am at your disposal . i was asking you what you thought of this attempt to assassinate macadam ? enfantillage replied poirot promptly . one can hardly take it seriously . to fire with the riflenever does it succeed . it is a device of the past . it was very near succeeding this time i reminded him . poirot shook his head impatiently . he was about to reply when the landlady thrust her head round the door and informed him that there were two gentlemen below who wanted to see him . they wont give their names sir but they says as its very important . let them mount said poirot carefully folding his grey trousers . in a few minutes the two visitors were ushered in and my heart gave a leap as in the foremost i recognized no less a personage than lord estair leader of the house of commons whilst his companion mr . bernard dodge was also a member of the war cabinet and as i knew a close personal friend of the prime minister . monsieur poirot ? said lord estair interrogatively . my friend bowed . the great man looked at me and hesitated . my business is private . you may speak freely before captain hastings said my friend nodding to me to remain . he has not all the gifts no but i answer for his discretion . lord estair still hesitated but mr . dodge broke in abruptly oh come ondont lets beat about the bush as far as i can see the whole of england will know the hole were in soon enough . times everything . pray be seated messieurs said poirot politely . will you take the big chair milord ? lord estair started slightly . you know me ? poirot smiled . certainly . i read the little papers with the pictures . how should i not know you ? monsieur poirot i have come to consult you upon a matter of the most vital urgency . i must ask for absolute secrecy . you have the word of hercule poiroti can say no more said my friend grandiloquently . it concerns the prime minister . we are in grave trouble . were up a tree interposed mr . dodge . the injury is serious then ? i asked . what injury ? the bullet wound . oh that cried mr . dodge contemptuously . thats old history . as my colleague says continued lord estair that affair is over and done with . luckily it failed . i wished i could say as much for the second attempt . there has been a second attempt then ? yes though not of the same nature . monsieur poirot the prime minister has disappeared . what ? he has been kidnapped impossible i cried stupefied . poirot threw a withering glance at me which i knew enjoined me to keep my mouth shut . unfortunately impossible as it seems it is only too true continued his lordship . poirot looked at mr . dodge . you said just now monsieur that time was everything . what did you mean by that ? the two men exchanged glances and then lord estair said you have heard monsieur poirot of the approaching allied conference ? my friend nodded . for obvious reasons no details have been given of when and where it is to take place . but although it has been kept out of the newspapers the date is of course widely known in diplomatic circles . the conference is to be held tomorrowthursdayevening at versailles . now you perceive the terrible gravity of the situation . i will not conceal from you that the prime ministers presence at the conference is a vital necessity . the pacifist propaganda started and maintained by the german agents in our midst has been very active . it is the universal opinion that the turning point of the conference will be the strong personality of the prime minister . his absence may have the most serious resultspossibly a premature and disastrous peace . and we have no one who can be sent in his place . he alone can represent england . poirots face had grown very grave . then you regard the kidnapping of the prime minister as a direct attempt to prevent his being present at the conference ? most certainly i do . he was actually on his way to france at the time . and the conference is to be held ? at nine oclock tomorrow night . poirot drew an enormous watch from his pocket . it is now a quarter to nine . twentyfour hours said mr . dodge thoughtfully . and a quarter amended poirot . do not forget the quarter monsieurit may come in useful . now for the detailsthe abduction did it take place in england or in france ? in france . mr . macadam crossed to france this morning . he was to stay tonight as the guest of the commanderinchief proceeding tomorrow to paris . he was conveyed across the channel by destroyer . at boulogne he was met by a car from general headquarters and one of the commanderinchiefs a .d .c .s . eh bien ? well they started from boulognebut they never arrived . what ? monsieur poirot it was a bogus car and a bogus a .d .c . the real car was found in a side road with the chauffeur and the a .d .c . neatly gagged and bound . and the bogus car ? is still at large . poirot made a gesture of impatience . incredible surely it cannot escape attention for long ? so we thought . it seemed merely a question of searching thoroughly . that part of france is under military law . we were convinced that the car could not go long unnoticed . the french police and our own scotland yard men and the military are straining every nerve . it is as you say incrediblebut nothing has been discovered at that moment a tap came at the door and a young officer entered with a heavily sealed envelope which he handed to lord estair . just through from france sir . i brought it on here as you directed . the minister tore it open eagerly and uttered an exclamation . the officer withdrew . here is news at last this telegram has just been decoded . they have found the second car also the secretary daniels chloroformed gagged and bound in an abandoned farm near c . he remembers nothing except something being pressed against his mouth and nose from behind and struggling to free himself . the police are satisfied as to the genuineness of his statement . and they have found nothing else ? no . not the prime ministers dead body ? then there is hope . but it is strange . why after trying to shoot him this morning are they now taking so much trouble to keep him alive ? dodge shook his head . one things quite certain . theyre determined at all costs to prevent his attending the conference . if it is humanly possible the prime minister shall be there . god grant it is not too late . now messieurs recount to me everythingfrom the beginning . i must know about this shooting affair as well . last night the prime minister accompanied by one of his secretaries captain daniels the same who accompanied him to france ? yes . as i was saying they motored down to windsor where the prime minister was granted an audience . early this morning he returned to town and it was on the way that the attempted assassination took place . one moment if you please . who is this captain daniels ? you have his dossier ? lord estair smiled . i thought you would ask me that . we do not know very much of him . he is of no particular family . he has served in the english army and is an extremely able secretary being an exceptionally fine linguist . i believe he speaks seven languages . it is for that reason that the prime minister chose him to accompany him to france . has he any relatives in england ? two aunts . a mrs . everard who lives at hampstead and a miss daniels who lives near ascot . ascot ? that is near to windsor is it not ? that point has not been overlooked . but it has led to nothing . you regard the capitaine daniels then as above suspicion ? a shade of bitterness crept into lord estairs voice as he replied no monsieur poirot . in these days i should hesitate before i pronounced anyone above suspicion . trs bien . now i understand milord that the prime minister would as a matter of course be under vigilant police protection which ought to render any assault upon him an impossibility ? lord estair bowed his head . that is so . the prime ministers car was closely followed by another car containing detectives in plain clothes . mr . macadam knew nothing of these precautions . he is personally a most fearless man and would be inclined to sweep them away arbitrarily . but naturally the police make their own arrangements . in fact the premiers chauffeur omurphy is a c .i .d . man . omurphy ? that is a name of ireland is it not so ? yes he is an irishman . from what part of ireland ? county clare i believe . tiens but proceed milord . the premier started for london . the car was a closed one . he and captain daniels sat inside . the second car followed as usual . but unluckily for some unknown reason the prime ministers car deviated from the main road at a point where the road curves ? interrupted poirot . yesbut how did you know ? oh cest vident continue for some unknown reason continued lord estair the premiers car left the main road . the police car unaware of the deviation continued to keep to the high road . at a short distance down the unfrequented lane the prime ministers car was suddenly held up by a band of masked men . the chauffeur that brave omurphy murmured poirot thoughtfully . the chauffeur momentarily taken aback jammed on the brakes . the prime minister put his head out of the window . instantly a shot rang outthen another . the first one grazed his cheek the second fortunately went wide . the chauffeur now realizing the danger instantly forged straight ahead scattering the band of men . a near escape i ejaculated with a shiver . mr . macadam refused to make any fuss over the slight wound he had received . he declared it was only a scratch . he stopped at a local cottage hospital where it was dressed and bound uphe did not of course reveal his identity . he then drove as per schedule straight to charing cross where a special train for dover was awaiting him and after a brief account of what had happened had been given to the anxious police by captain daniels he duly departed for france . at dover he went on board the waiting destroyer . at boulogne as you know the bogus car was waiting for him carrying the union jack and correct in every detail . that is all you have to tell me ? yes . there is no other circumstance that you have omitted milord ? well there is one rather peculiar thing . yes ? the prime ministers car did not return home after leaving the prime minister at charing cross . the police were anxious to interview omurphy so a search was instituted at once . the car was discovered standing outside a certain unsavoury little restaurant in soho which is well known as a meetingplace of german agents . and the chauffeur ? the chauffeur was nowhere to be found . he too had disappeared . so said poirot thoughtfully there are two disappearances the prime minister in france and omurphy in london . he looked keenly at lord estair who made a gesture of despair . i can only tell you monsieur poirot that if anyone had suggested to me yesterday that omurphy was a traitor i should have laughed in his face . and today ? today i do not know what to think . poirot nodded gravely . he looked at his turnip of a watch again . i understand that i have carte blanche messieursin every way i mean ? i must be able to go where i choose and how i choose . perfectly . there is a special train leaving for dover in an hours time with a further contingent from scotland yard . you shall be accompanied by a military officer and a c .i .d . man who will hold themselves at your disposal in every way . is that satisfactory ? quite . one more question before you leave messieurs . what made you come to me ? i am unknown obscure in this great london of yours . we sought you out on the express recommendation and wish of a very great man of your own country . comment ? my old friend the prfet ? lord estair shook his head . one higher than the prfet . one whose word was once law in belgiumand shall be again that england has sworn poirots hand flew swiftly to a dramatic salute . amen to that ah but my master does not forget .  .  .  . messieurs i hercule poirot will serve you faithfully . heaven only send that it will be in time . but this is darkdark .  .  .  . i cannot see . well poirot i cried impatiently as the door closed behind the ministers what do you think ? my friend was busy packing a minute suitcase with quick deft movements . he shook his head thoughtfully . i do not know what to think . my brains desert me . why as you said kidnap him when a knock on the head would do as well ? i mused . pardon me mon ami but i did not quite say that . it is undoubtedly far more their affair to kidnap him . but why ? because uncertainty creates panic . that is one reason . were the prime minister dead it would be a terrible calamity but the situation would have to be faced . but now you have paralysis . will the prime minister reappear or will he not ? is he dead or alive ? nobody knows and until they know nothing definite can be done . and as i tell you uncertainty breeds panic which is what les boches are playing for . then again if the kidnappers are holding him secretly somewhere they have the advantage of being able to make terms with both sides . the german government is not a liberal paymaster as a rule but no doubt they can be made to disgorge substantial remittances in such a case as this . thirdly they run no risk of the hangmans rope . oh decidedly kidnapping is their affair . then if that is so why should they first try to shoot him ? poirot made a gesture of anger . ah that is just what i do not understand it is inexplicablestupid they have all their arrangements made and very good arrangements too for the abduction and yet they imperil the whole affair by a melodramatic attack worthy of a cinema and quite as unreal . it is almost impossible to believe in it with its band of masked men not twenty miles from london perhaps they were two quite separate attempts which happened irrespective of each other i suggested . ah no that would be too much of a coincidence then furtherwho is the traitor ? there must have been a traitorin the first affair anyway . but who was itdaniels or omurphy ? it must have been one of the two or why did the car leave the main road ? we cannot suppose that the prime minister connived at his own assassination did omurphy take that turning of his own accord or was it daniels who told him to do so ? surely it must have been omurphys doing . yes because if it was daniels the prime minister would have heard the order and would have asked the reason . but there are altogether too many whys in this affair and they contradict each other . if omurphy is an honest man why did he leave the main road ? but if he was a dishonest man why did he start the car again when only two shots had been firedthereby in all probability saving the prime ministers life ? and again if he was honest why did he immediately on leaving charing cross drive to a wellknown rendezvous of german spies ? it looks bad i said . let us look at the case with method . what have we for and against these two men ? take omurphy first . against that his conduct in leaving the main road was suspicious that he is an irishman from county clare that he has disappeared in a highly suggestive manner . for that his promptness in restarting the car saved the premiers life that he is a scotland yard man and obviously from the post allotted to him a trusted detective . now for daniels . there is not much against him except the fact that nothing is known of his antecedents and that he speaks too many languages for a good englishman pardon me mon ami but as linguists you are deplorable now for him we have the fact that he was found gagged bound and chloroformedwhich does not look as though he had anything to do with the matter . he might have gagged and bound himself to divert suspicion . poirot shook his head . the french police would make no mistake of that kind . besides once he had attained his object and the prime minister was safely abducted there would not be much point in his remaining behind . his accomplices could have gagged and chloroformed him of course but i fail to see what object they hoped to accomplish by it . he can be of little use to them now for until the circumstances concerning the prime minister have been cleared up he is bound to be closely watched . perhaps he hoped to start the police on a false scent ? then why did he not do so ? he merely says that something was pressed over his nose and mouth and that he remembers nothing more . there is no false scent there . it sounds remarkably like the truth . well i said glancing at the clock i suppose wed better start for the station . you may find more clues in france . possibly mon ami but i doubt it . it is still incredible to me that the prime minister has not been discovered in that limited area where the difficulty of concealing him must be tremendous . if the military and the police of two countries have not found him how shall i ? at charing cross we were met by mr . dodge . this is detective barnes of scotland yard and major norman . they will hold themselves entirely at your disposal . good luck to you . its a bad business but ive not given up hope . must be off now . and the minister strode rapidly away . we chatted in a desultory fashion with major norman . in the centre of the little group of men on the platform i recognized a little ferretfaced fellow talking to a tall fair man . he was an old acquaintance of poirotsdetectiveinspector japp supposed to be one of the smartest of scotland yards officers . he came over and greeted my friend cheerfully . i heard you were on this job too . smart bit of work . so far theyve got away with the goods all right . but i cant believe they can keep him hidden long . our people are going through france with a toothcomb . so are the french . i cant help feeling its only a matter of hours now . that is if hes still alive remarked the tall detective gloomily . japps face fell . yes .  .  .  . but somehow ive got the feeling hes alive all right . poirot nodded . yes yes hes alive . but can he be found in time ? i like you did not believe he could be hidden so long . the whistle blew and we all trooped up into the pullman car . then with a slow unwilling jerk the train drew out of the station . it was a curious journey . the scotland yard men crowded together . maps of northern france were spread out and eager forefingers traced the lines of roads and villages . each man had his own pet theory . poirot showed none of his usual loquacity but sat staring in front of him with an expression on his face that reminded me of a puzzled child . i talked to norman whom i found quite an amusing fellow . on arriving at dover poirots behaviour moved me to intense amusement . the little man as he went on board the boat clutched desperately at my arm . the wind was blowing lustily . mon dieu he murmured . this is terrible have courage poirot i cried . you will succeed . you will find him . i am sure of it . ah mon ami you mistake my emotion . it is this villainous sea that troubles me the mal de merit is horrible suffering oh i said rather taken aback . the first throb of the engines was felt and poirot groaned and closed his eyes . major norman has a map of northern france if you would like to study it ? poirot shook his head impatiently . but no but no leave me my friend . see you to think the stomach and the brain must be in harmony . laverguier has a method most excellent for averting the mal de mer . you breathe inand outslowly soturning the head from left to right and counting six between each breath . i left him to his gymnastic endeavours and went on deck . as we came slowly into boulogne harbour poirot appeared neat and smiling and announced to me in a whisper that laverguiers system had succeeded to a marvel japps forefinger was still tracing imaginary routes on his map . nonsense the car started from boulognehere they branched off . now my idea is that they transferred the prime minister to another car . see ? well said the tall detective i shall make for the seaports . ten to one theyve smuggled him on board a ship . japp shook his head . too obvious . the order went out at once to close all the ports . the day was just breaking as we landed . major norman touched poirot on the arm . theres a military car here waiting for you sir . thank you monsieur . but for the moment i do not propose to leave boulogne . what ? no we will enter this hotel here by the quay . he suited the action to the word demanded and was accorded a private room . we three followed him puzzled and uncomprehending . he shot a quick glance at us . it is not so that the good detective should act eh ? i perceive your thought . he must be full of energy . he must rush to and fro . he should prostrate himself on the dusty road and seek the marks of tyres through a little glass . he must gather up the cigaretteend the fallen match ? that is your idea is it not ? his eyes challenged us . but ihercule poirottell you that it is not so the true clues are withinhere he tapped his forehead . see you i need not have left london . it would have been sufficient for me to sit quietly in my rooms there . all that matters is the little grey cells within . secretly and silently they do their part until suddenly i call for a map and i lay my finger on a spotsoand i say the prime minister is there and it is so with method and logic one can accomplish anything this frantic rushing to france was a mistakeit is playing a childs game of hideandseek . but now though it may be too late i will set to work the right way from within . silence my friends i beg of you . and for five long hours the little man sat motionless blinking his eyelids like a cat his green eyes flickering and becoming steadily greener and greener . the scotland yard man was obviously contemptuous major norman was bored and impatient and i myself found the time pass with wearisome slowness . finally i got up and strolled as noiselessly as i could to the window . the matter was becoming a farce . i was secretly concerned for my friend . if he failed i would have preferred him to fail in a less ridiculous manner . out of the window i idly watched the daily leave boat belching forth columns of smoke as she lay alongside the quay . suddenly i was aroused by poirots voice close to my elbow . mes amis let us start i turned . an extraordinary transformation had come over my friend . his eyes were flickering with excitement his chest was swelled to the uttermost . i have been an imbecile my friends but i see daylight at last . major norman moved hastily to the door . ill order the car . there is no need . i shall not use it . thank heaven the wind has fallen . do you mean you are going to walk sir ? no my young friend . i am no st . peter . i prefer to cross the sea by boat . to cross the sea ? yes . to work with method one must begin from the beginning . and the beginning of this affair was in england . therefore we return to england .        at three oclock we stood once more upon charing cross platform . to all our expostulations poirot turned a deaf ear and reiterated again and again that to start at the beginning was not a waste of time but the only way . on the way over he had conferred with norman in a low voice and the latter had despatched a sheaf of telegrams from dover . owing to the special passes held by norman we got through everywhere in record time . in london a large police car was waiting for us with some plainclothes men one of whom handed a typewritten sheet of paper to my friend . he answered my inquiring glance . a list of the cottage hospitals within a certain radius west of london . i wired for it from dover . we were whirled rapidly through the london streets . we were on the bath road . on we went through hammersmith chiswick and brentford . i began to see our objective . through windsor and on to ascot . my heart gave a leap . ascot was where daniels had an aunt living . we were after him then not omurphy . we duly stopped at the gate of a trim villa . poirot jumped out and rang the bell . i saw a perplexed frown dimming the radiance of his face . plainly he was not satisfied . the bell was answered . he was ushered inside . in a few moments he reappeared and climbed into the car with a short sharp shake of his head . my hopes began to die down . it was past four now . even if he found certain evidence incriminating daniels what would be the good of it unless he could wring from some one the exact spot in france where they were holding the prime minister ? our return progress towards london was an interrupted one . we deviated from the main road more than once and occasionally stopped at a small building which i had no difficulty in recognizing as a cottage hospital . poirot only spent a few minutes at each but at every halt his radiant assurance was more and more restored . he whispered something to norman to which the latter replied yes if you turn off to the left you will find them waiting by the bridge . we turned up a side road and in the failing light i discerned a second car waiting by the side of the road . it contained two men in plain clothes . poirot got down and spoke to them and then we started off in a northerly direction the other car following close behind . we drove for some time our objective being obviously one of the northern suburbs of london . finally we drove up to the front door of a tall house standing a little back from the road in its own grounds . norman and i were left with the car . poirot and one of the detectives went up to the door and rang . a neat parlourmaid opened it . the detective spoke . i am a police officer and i have a warrant to search this house . the girl gave a little scream and a tall handsome woman of middleage appeared behind her in the hall . shut the door edith . they are burglars i expect . but poirot swiftly inserted his foot in the door and at the same moment blew a whistle . instantly the other detectives ran up and poured into the house shutting the door behind them . norman and i spent about five minutes cursing our forced inactivity . finally the door reopened and the men emerged escorting three prisonersa woman and two men . the woman and one of the men were taken to the second car . the other man was placed in our car by poirot himself . i must go with the others my friend . but have great care of this gentleman . you do not know him no ? eh bien let me present to you monsieur omurphy omurphy i gaped at him openmouthed as we started again . he was not handcuffed but i did not fancy he would try to escape . he sat there staring in front of him as though dazed . anyway norman and i would be more than a match for him . to my surprise we still kept a northerly route . we were not returning to london then i was much puzzled . suddenly as the car slowed down i recognized that we were close to hendon aerodrome . immediately i grasped poirots idea . he proposed to reach france by aeroplane . it was a sporting idea but on the face of it impracticable . a telegram would be far quicker . time was everything . he must leave the personal glory of rescuing the prime minister to others . as we drew up major norman jumped out and a plainclothes man took his place . he conferred with poirot for a few minutes and then went off briskly . i too jumped out and caught poirot by the arm . i congratulate you old fellow they have told you the hidingplace ? but look here you must wire to france at once . youll be too late if you go yourself . poirot looked at me curiously for a minute or two . unfortunately my friend there are some things that cannot be sent by telegram .        at that moment major norman returned accompanied by a young officer in the uniform of the flying corps . this is captain lyall who will fly you over to france . he can start at once . wrap up warmly sir said the young pilot . i can lend you a coat if you like . poirot was consulting his enormous watch . he murmured to himself yes there is timejust time . then he looked up and bowed politely to the young officer . i thank you monsieur . but it is not i who am your passenger . it is this gentleman here . he moved a little aside as he spoke and a figure came forward out of the darkness . it was the second male prisoner who had gone in the other car and as the light fell on his face i gave a gasp of surprise . it was the prime minister        for heavens sake tell me all about it i cried impatiently as poirot norman and i motored back to london . how in the world did they manage to smuggle him back to england ? there was no need to smuggle him back replied poirot dryly . the prime minister has never left england . he was kidnapped on his way from windsor to london . what ? i will make all clear . the prime minister was in his car his secretary beside him . suddenly a pad of chloroform is clapped on his face but by whom ? by the clever linguistic captain daniels . as soon as the prime minister is unconscious daniels picks up the speakingtube and directs omurphy to turn to the right which the chauffeur quite unsuspicious does . a few yards down that unfrequented road a large car is standing apparently broken down . its driver signals to omurphy to stop . omurphy slows up . the stranger approaches . daniels leans out of the window and probably with the aid of an instantaneous ansthetic such as ethylchloride the chloroform trick is repeated . in a few seconds the two helpless men are dragged out and transferred to the other car and a pair of substitutes take their places . impossible pas du tout have you not seen musichall turns imitating celebrities with marvellous accuracy ? nothing is easier than to personate a public character . the prime minister of england is far easier to understudy than mr . john smith of clapham say . as for omurphys double no one was going to take much notice of him until after the departure of the prime minister and by then he would have made himself scarce . he drives straight from charing cross to the meetingplace of his friends . he goes in as omurphy he emerges as some one quite different . omurphy has disappeared leaving a conveniently suspicious trail behind him . but the man who personated the prime minister was seen by every one he was not seen by anyone who knew him privately or intimately . and daniels shielded him from contact with anyone as much as possible . moreover his face was bandaged up and anything unusual in his manner would be put down to the fact that he was suffering from shock as a result of the attempt upon his life . mr . macadam has a weak throat and always spares his voice as much as possible before any great speech . the deception was perfectly easy to keep up as far as france . there it would be impracticable and impossibleso the prime minister disappears . the police of this country hurry across the channel and no one bothers to go into the details of the first attack . to sustain the illusion that the abduction has taken place in france daniels is gagged and chloroformed in a convincing manner . and the man who has enacted the part of the prime minister ? rids himself of his disguise . he and the bogus chauffeur may be arrested as suspicious characters but no one will dream of suspecting their real part in the drama and they will eventually be released for lack of evidence . and the real prime minister ? he and omurphy were driven straight to the house of mrs . everard at hampstead daniels socalled aunt . in reality she is frau bertha ebenthal and the police have been looking for her for some time . it is a valuable little present that i have made to themto say nothing of daniels ah it was a clever plan but he did not reckon on the cleverness of hercule poirot i think my friend might well be excused his moment of vanity . when did you first begin to suspect the truth of the matter ? when i began to work the right wayfrom within i could not make that shooting affair fit inbut when i saw that the net result of it was that the prime minister went to france with his face bound up i began to comprehend and when i visited all the cottage hospitals between windsor and london and found that no one answering to my description had had his face bound up and dressed that morning i was sure after that it was childsplay for a mind like mine        the following morning poirot showed me a telegram he had just received . it had no place of origin and was unsigned . it ran in time . later in the day the evening papers published an account of the allied conference . they laid particular stress on the magnificent ovation accorded to mr . david macadam whose inspiring speech had produced a deep and lasting impression . ix the disappearance of mr . davenheim poirot and i were expecting our old friend inspector japp of scotland yard to tea . we were sitting round the teatable awaiting his arrival . poirot had just finished carefully straightening the cups and saucers which our landlady was in the habit of throwing rather than placing on the table . he had also breathed heavily on the metal teapot and polished it with a silk handkerchief . the kettle was on the boil and a small enamel saucepan beside it contained some thick sweet chocolate which was more to poirots palate than what he described as your english poison . a sharp rattat sounded below and a few minutes afterwards japp entered briskly . hope im not late he said as he greeted us . to tell the truth i was yarning with miller the man whos in charge of the davenheim case . i pricked up my ears . for the last three days the papers had been full of the strange disappearance of mr . davenheim senior partner of davenheim and salmon the wellknown bankers and financiers . on saturday last he had walked out of his house and had never been seen since . i looked forward to extracting some interesting details from japp . i should have thought i remarked that it would be almost impossible for anyone to disappear nowadays . poirot moved a plate of bread and butter the eighth of an inch and said sharply be exact my friend . what do you mean by disappear ? to which class of disappearance are you referring ? are disappearances classified and labelled then ? i laughed . japp smiled also . poirot frowned at us both . but certainly they are they fall into three categories first and most common the voluntary disappearance . second the much abused loss of memory caserare but occasionally genuine . third murder and a more or less successful disposal of the body . do you refer to all three as impossible of execution ? very nearly so i should think . you might lose your own memory but some one would be sure to recognize youespecially in the case of a wellknown man like davenheim . then bodies cant be made to vanish into thin air . sooner or later they turn up concealed in lonely places or in trunks . murder will out . in the same way the absconding clerk or the domestic defaulter is bound to be run down in these days of wireless telegraphy . he can be headed off from foreign countries ports and railway stations are watched and as for concealment in this country his features and appearance will be known to every one who reads a daily newspaper . hes up against civilization . mon ami said poirot you make one error . you do not allow for the fact that a man who had decided to make away with another manor with himself in a figurative sensemight be that rare machine a man of method . he might bring intelligence talent a careful calculation of detail to the task and then i do not see why he should not be successful in baffling the police force . but not you i suppose ? said japp goodhumouredly winking at me . he couldnt baffle you eh monsieur poirot ? poirot endeavoured with a marked lack of success to look modest . me also why not ? it is true that i approach such problems with an exact science a mathematical precision which seems alas only too rare in the new generation of detectives japp grinned more widely . i dont know he said . miller the man whos on this case is a smart chap . you may be very sure he wont overlook a footprint or a cigarash or a crumb even . hes got eyes that see everything . so mon ami said poirot has the london sparrow . but all the same i should not ask the little brown bird to solve the problem of mr . davenheim . come now monsieur youre not going to run down the value of details as clues ? by no means . these things are all good in their way . the danger is they may assume undue importance . most details are insignificant one or two are vital . it is the brain the little grey cellshe tapped his foreheadon which one must rely . the senses mislead . one must seek the truth withinnot without . you dont mean to say monsieur poirot that you would undertake to solve a case without moving from your chair do you ? that is exactly what i do meangranted the facts were placed before me . i regard myself as a consulting specialist . japp slapped his knee . hanged if i dont take you at your word . bet you a fiver that you cant lay your handor rather tell me where to lay my handon mr . davenheim dead or alive before a week is out . poirot considered . eh bien mon ami i accept . le sport it is the passion of you english . nowthe facts . on saturday last as is his usual custom mr . davenheim took the  . train from victoria to chingside where his palatial country place the cedars is situated . after lunch he strolled round the grounds and gave various directions to the gardeners . everybody agrees that his manner was absolutely normal and as usual . after tea he put his head into his wifes boudoir saying that he was going to stroll down to the village and post some letters . he added that he was expecting a mr . lowen on business . if he should come before he himself returned he was to be shown into the study and asked to wait . mr . davenheim then left the house by the front door passed leisurely down the drive and out at the gate andwas never seen again . from that hour he vanished completely . prettyvery prettyaltogether a charming little problem murmured poirot . proceed my good friend . about a quarter of an hour later a tall dark man with a thick black moustache rang the frontdoor bell and explained that he had an appointment with mr . davenheim . he gave the name of lowen and in accordance with the bankers instructions was shown into the study . nearly an hour passed . mr . davenheim did not return . finally mr . lowen rang the bell and explained that he was unable to wait any longer as he must catch his train back to town . mrs . davenheim apologized for her husbands absence which seemed unaccountable as she knew him to have been expecting the visitor . mr . lowen reiterated his regrets and took his departure . well as every one knows mr . davenheim did not return . early on sunday morning the police were communicated with but could make neither head nor tail of the matter . mr . davenheim seemed literally to have vanished into thin air . he had not been to the post office nor had he been seen passing through the village . at the station they were positive he had not departed by any train . his own motor had not left the garage . if he had hired a car to meet him in some lonely spot it seems almost certain that by this time in view of the large reward offered for information the driver of it would have come forward to tell what he knew . true there was a small racemeeting at entfield five miles away and if he had walked to that station he might have passed unnoticed in the crowd . but since then his photograph and a full description of him have been circulated in every newspaper and nobody has been able to give any news of him . we have of course received many letters from all over england but each clue so far has ended in disappointment . on monday morning a further sensational discovery came to light . behind a portire in mr . davenheims study stands a safe and that safe had been broken into and rifled . the windows were fastened securely on the inside which seems to put an ordinary burglary out of court unless of course an accomplice within the house fastened them again afterwards . on the other hand sunday having intervened and the household being in a state of chaos it is likely that the burglary was committed on the saturday and remained undetected until monday . prcisment said poirot dryly . well is he arrested ce pauvre m . lowen ? japp grinned . not yet . but hes under pretty close supervision . poirot nodded . what was taken from the safe ? have you any idea ? weve been going into that with the junior partner of the firm and mrs . davenheim . apparently there was a considerable amount in bearer bonds and a very large sum in notes owing to some large transaction having been just carried through . there was also a small fortune in jewellery . all mrs . davenheims jewels were kept in the safe . the purchasing of them had become a passion with her husband of late years and hardly a month passed that he did not make her a present of some rare and costly gem . altogether a good haul said poirot thoughtfully . now what about lowen ? is it known what his business was with davenheim that evening ? well the two men were apparently not on very good terms . lowen is a speculator in quite a small way . nevertheless he has been able once or twice to score a coup off davenheim in the market though it seems they seldom or never actually met . it was a matter concerning some south american shares which led the banker to make his appointment . had davenheim interests in south america then ? i believe so . mrs . davenheim happened to mention that he spent all last autumn in buenos ayres . any trouble in his home life ? were the husband and wife on good terms ? i should say his domestic life was quite peaceful and uneventful . mrs . davenheim is a pleasant rather unintelligent woman . quite a nonentity i think . then we must not look for the solution of the mystery there . had he any enemies ? he had plenty of financial rivals and no doubt there are many people whom he has got the better of who bear him no particular goodwill . but there was no one likely to make away with himand if they had where is the body ? exactly . as hastings says bodies have a habit of coming to light with fatal persistency . by the way one of the gardeners says he saw a figure going round to the side of the house toward the rosegarden . the long french window of the study opens on to the rosegarden and mr . davenheim frequently entered and left the house that way . but the man was a good way off at work on some cucumber frames and cannot even say whether it was the figure of his master or not . also he cannot fix the time with any accuracy . it must have been before six as the gardeners cease work at that time . and mr . davenheim left the house ? about halfpast five or thereabouts . what lies beyond the rosegarden ? a lake . with a boathouse ? yes a couple of punts are kept there . i suppose youre thinking of suicide monsieur poirot ? well i dont mind telling you that millers going down tomorrow expressly to see that piece of water dragged . thats the kind of man he is poirot smiled faintly and turned to me . hastings i pray you hand me that copy of the daily megaphone . if i remember rightly there is an unusually clear photograph there of the missing man . i rose and found the sheet required . poirot studied the features attentively . hm he murmured . wears his hair rather long and wavy full moustache and pointed beard bushy eyebrows . eyes dark ? yes . hair and beard turning grey ? the detective nodded . well monsieur poirot what have you got to say to it all ? clear as daylight eh ? on the contrary most obscure . the scotland yard man looked pleased . which gives me great hopes of solving it finished poirot placidly . eh ? i find it a good sign when a case is obscure . if a thing is clear as daylighteh bien mistrust it some one has made it so . japp shook his head almost pityingly . well each to their fancy . but its not a bad thing to see your way clear ahead . i do not see murmured poirot . i shut my eyesand think . japp sighed . well youve got a clear week to think in . and you will bring me any fresh developments that arisethe result of the labours of the hardworking and lynxeyed inspector miller for instance ? certainly . thats in the bargain . seems a shame doesnt it ? said japp to me as i accompanied him to the door . like robbing a child i could not help agreeing with a smile . i was still smiling as i reentered the room . eh bien said poirot immediately . you make fun of papa poirot is it not so ? he shook his finger at me . you do not trust his grey cells ? ah do not be confused let us discuss this little problemincomplete as yet i admit but already showing one or two points of interest . the lake i said significantly . and even more than the lake the boathouse i looked sidewise at poirot . he was smiling in his most inscrutable fashion . i felt that for the moment it would be quite useless to question him further . we heard nothing of japp until the following evening when he walked in about nine oclock . i saw at once by his expression that he was bursting with news of some kind . eh bien my friend remarked poirot . all goes well ? but do not tell me that you have discovered the body of mr . davenheim in your lake because i shall not believe you . we havent found the body but we did find his clothesthe identical clothes he was wearing that day . what do you say to that ? any other clothes missing from the house ? no his valet is quite positive on that point . the rest of his wardrobe is intact . theres more . weve arrested lowen . one of the maids whose business it is to fasten the bedroom windows declares that she saw lowen coming towards the study through the rosegarden about a quarter past six . that would be about ten minutes before he left the house . what does he himself say to that ? denied first of all that he had ever left the study . but the maid was positive and he pretended afterwards that he had forgotten just stepping out of the window to examine an unusual species of rose . rather a weak story and theres fresh evidence against him come to light . mr . davenheim always wore a thick gold ring set with a solitaire diamond on the little finger of his right hand . well that ring was pawned in london on saturday night by a man called billy kellett hes already known to the policedid three months last autumn for lifting an old gentlemans watch . it seems he tried to pawn the ring at no less than five different places succeeded at the last one got gloriously drunk on the proceeds assaulted a policeman and was run in in consequence . i went to bow street with miller and saw him . hes sober enough now and i dont mind admitting we pretty well frightened the life out of him hinting he might be charged with murder . this is his yarn and a very queer one it is . he was at entfield races on saturday though i dare say scarfpins was his line of business rather than betting . anyway he had a bad day and was down on his luck . he was tramping along the road to chingside and sat down in a ditch to rest just before he got into the village . a few minutes later he noticed a man coming along the road to the village darkcomplexioned gent with a big moustache one of them city toffs is his description of the man . kellett was half concealed from the road by a heap of stones . just before he got abreast of him the man looked quickly up and down the road and seeing it apparently deserted he took a small object from his pocket and threw it over the hedge . then he went on towards the station . now the object he had thrown over the hedge had fallen with a slight chink which aroused the curiosity of the human derelict in the ditch . he investigated and after a short search discovered the ring that is kelletts story . its only fair to say that lowen denies it utterly and of course the word of a man like kellett cant be relied upon in the slightest . its within the bounds of possibility that he met davenheim in the lane and robbed and murdered him . poirot shook his head . very improbable mon ami . he had no means of disposing of the body . it would have been found by now . secondly the open way in which he pawned the ring makes it unlikely that he did murder to get it . thirdly your sneakthief is rarely a murderer . fourthly as he has been in prison since saturday it would be too much of a coincidence that he is able to give so accurate a description of lowen . japp nodded . i dont say youre not right . but all the same you wont get a jury to take much note of a jailbirds evidence . what seems odd to me is that lowen couldnt find a cleverer way of disposing of the ring . poirot shrugged his shoulders . well after all if it were found in the neighbourhood it might be argued that davenheim himself had dropped it . but why remove it from the body at all ? i cried . there might be a reason for that said japp . do you know that just beyond the lake a little gate leads out on to the hill and not three minutes walk brings you towhat do you think ?a lime kiln . good heavens i cried . you mean that the lime which destroyed the body would be powerless to affect the metal of the ring ? exactly . it seems to me i said that that explains everything . what a horrible crime by common consent we both turned and looked at poirot . he seemed lost in reflection his brow knitted as though with some supreme mental effort . i felt that at last his keen intellect was asserting itself . what would his first words be ? we were not long left in doubt . with a sigh the tension of his attitude relaxed and turning to japp he asked have you any idea my friend whether mr . and mrs . davenheim occupied the same bedroom ? the question seemed so ludicrously inappropriate that for a moment we both stared in silence . then japp burst into a laugh . good lord monsieur poirot i thought you were coming out with something startling . as to your question im sure i dont know . you could find out ? asked poirot with curious persistence . oh certainlyif you really want to know . merci mon ami . i should be obliged if you would make a point of it . japp stared at him a few minutes longer but poirot seemed to have forgotten us both . the detective shook his head sadly at me and murmuring poor old fellow wars been too much for him gently withdrew from the room . as poirot still seemed sunk in a daydream i took a sheet of paper and amused myself by scribbling notes upon it . my friends voice aroused me . he had come out of his reverie and was looking brisk and alert . que faitesvous l mon ami ? i was jotting down what occurred to me as the main points of interest in this affair . you become methodicalat last said poirot approvingly . i concealed my pleasure . shall i read them to you ? by all means . i cleared my throat . one all the evidence points to lowen having been the man who forced the safe . two he had a grudge against davenheim . three he lied in his first statement that he had never left the study . four if you accept billy kelletts story as true lowen is unmistakably implicated . i paused . well ? i asked for i felt that i had put my finger on all the vital facts . poirot looked at me pityingly shaking his head very gently . mon pauvre ami but it is that you have not the gift the important detail you appreciate him never also your reasoning is false . how ? let me take your four points . one mr . lowen could not possibly know that he would have the chance to open the safe . he came for a business interview . he could not know beforehand that mr . davenheim would be absent posting a letter and that he would consequently be alone in the study he might have seized his opportunity i suggested . and the tools ? city gentlemen do not carry round housebreakers tools on the off chance and one could not cut into that safe with a penknife bien entendu well what about number two ? you say lowen had a grudge against mr . davenheim . what you mean is that he had once or twice got the better of him . and presumably those transactions were entered into with the view of benefiting himself . in any case you do not as a rule bear a grudge against a man you have got the better ofit is more likely to be the other way about . whatever grudge there might have been would have been on mr . davenheims side . well you cant deny that he lied about never having left the study ? no . but he may have been frightened . remember the missing mans clothes had just been discovered in the lake . of course as usual he would have done better to speak the truth . and the fourth point ? i grant you that . if kelletts story is true lowen is undeniably implicated . that is what makes the affair so very interesting . then i did appreciate one vital fact ? perhapsbut you have entirely overlooked the two most important points the ones which undoubtedly hold the clue to the whole matter . and pray what are they ? one the passion which has grown upon mr . davenheim in the last few years for buying jewellery . two his trip to buenos ayres last autumn . poirot you are joking i am most serious . ah sacred thunder but i hope japp will not forget my little commission . but the detective entering into the spirit of the joke had remembered it so well that a telegram was handed to poirot about eleven oclock the next day . at his request i opened it and read it out husband and wife have occupied separate rooms since last winter . aha cried poirot . and now we are in mid june all is solved i stared at him . you have no moneys in the bank of davenheim and salmon mon ami ? no i said wondering . why ? because i should advise you to withdraw itbefore it is too late . why what do you expect ? i expect a big smash in a few daysperhaps sooner . which reminds me we will return the compliment of a dpche to japp . a pencil i pray you and a form . voil advise you to withdraw any money deposited with firm in question . that will intrigue him the good japp his eyes will open widewide he will not comprehend in the slightestuntil tomorrow or the next day i remained sceptical but the morrow forced me to render tribute to my friends remarkable powers . in every paper was a huge headline telling of the sensational failure of the davenheim bank . the disappearance of the famous financier took on a totally different aspect in the light of the revelation of the financial affairs of the bank . before we were halfway through breakfast the door flew open and japp rushed in . in his left hand was a paper in his right was poirots telegram which he banged down on the table in front of my friend . how did you know monsieur poirot ? how the blazes could you know ? poirot smiled placidly at him . ah mon ami after your wire it was a certainty from the commencement see you it struck me that the safe burglary was somewhat remarkable . jewels ready money bearer bondsall so conveniently arranged forwhom ? well the good monsieur davenheim was of those who look after number one as your saying goes it seemed almost certain that it was arranged forhimself then his passion of late years for buying jewellery how simple the funds he embezzled he converted into jewels very likely replacing them in turn with paste duplicates and so he put away in a safe place under another name a considerable fortune to be enjoyed all in good time when every one has been thrown off the track . his arrangements completed he makes an appointment with mr . lowen who has been imprudent enough in the past to cross the great man once or twice drills a hole in the safe leaves orders that the guest is to be shown into the study and walks out of the housewhere ? poirot stopped and stretched out his hand for another boiled egg . he frowned . it is really insupportable he murmured that every hen lays an egg of a different size what symmetry can there be on the breakfast table ? at least they should sort them in dozens at the shop never mind the eggs said japp impatiently . let em lay em square if they like . tell us where our customer went to when he left the cedarsthat is if you know eh bien he went to his hidingplace . ah this monsieur davenheim there may be some malformation in his grey cells but they are of the first quality do you know where he is hiding ? certainly it is most ingenious . for the lords sake tell us then poirot gently collected every fragment of shell from his plate placed them in the eggcup and reversed the empty eggshell on top of them . this little operation concluded he smiled on the neat effect and then beamed affectionately on us both . come my friends you are men of intelligence . ask yourselves the question which i asked myself . if i were this man where should i hide ? hastings what do you say ? well i said im rather inclined to think id not do a bolt at all . id stay in londonin the heart of things travel by tubes and buses ten to one id never be recognized . theres safety in a crowd . poirot turned inquiringly to japp . i dont agree . get clear away at oncethats the only chance . i would have had plenty of time to prepare things beforehand . id have a yacht waiting with steam up and id be off to one of the most outoftheway corners of the world before the hue and cry began we both looked at poirot . what do you say monsieur ? for a moment he remained silent . then a very curious smile flitted across his face . my friends if i were hiding from the police do you know where i should hide ? in a prison what ? you are seeking monsieur davenheim in order to put him in prison so you never dream of looking to see if he may not be already there what do you mean ? you tell me madame davenheim is not a very intelligent woman . nevertheless i think that if you took her to bow street and confronted her with the man billy kellett she would recognize him in spite of the fact that he has shaved his beard and moustache and those bushy eyebrows and has cropped his hair close . a woman nearly always knows her husband though the rest of the world may be deceived billy kellett ? but hes known to the police did i not tell you davenheim was a clever man ? he prepared his alibi long beforehand . he was not in buenos ayres last autumnhe was creating the character of billy kellett doing three months so that the police should have no suspicions when the time came . he was playing remember for a large fortune as well as liberty . it was worth while doing the thing thoroughly . only yes ? eh bien afterwards he had to wear a false beard and wig had to make up as himself again and to sleep with a false beard is not easyit invites detection he cannot risk continuing to share the chamber of madame his wife . you found out for me that for the last six months or ever since his supposed return from buenos ayres he and mrs . davenheim occupied separate rooms . then i was sure everything fitted in . the gardener who fancied he saw his master going round to the side of the house was quite right . he went to the boathouse donned his tramp clothes which you may be sure had been safely hidden from the eyes of his valet dropped the others in the lake and proceeded to carry out his plan by pawning the ring in an obvious manner and then assaulting a policeman getting himself safely into the haven of bow street where nobody would ever dream of looking for him its impossible murmured japp . ask madame said my friend smiling . the next day a registered letter lay beside poirots plate . he opened it and a fivepound note fluttered out . my friends brow puckered . ah sacr but what shall i do with it ? i have much remorse ce pauvre japp ah an idea we will have a little dinner we three that consoles me . it was really too easy . i am ashamed . i who would not rob a childmille tonnerres mon ami what have you that you laugh so heartily ? x the adventure of the italian nobleman poirot and i had many friends and acquaintances of an informal nature . amongst these was to be numbered dr . hawker a near neighbour of ours and a member of the medical profession . it was the genial doctors habit to drop in sometimes of an evening and have a chat with poirot of whose genius he was an ardent admirer . the doctor himself frank and unsuspicious to the last degree admired the talents so far removed from his own . on one particular evening in early june he arrived about halfpast eight and settled down to a comfortable discussion on the cheery topic of the prevalence of arsenical poisoning in crimes . it must have been about a quarter of an hour later when the door of our sittingroom flew open and a distracted female precipitated herself into the room . oh doctor youre wanted such a terrible voice . it gave me a turn it did indeed . i recognized in our new visitor dr . hawkers housekeeper miss rider . the doctor was a bachelor and lived in a gloomy old house a few streets away . the usually placid miss rider was now in a state bordering on incoherence . what terrible voice ? who is it and whats the trouble ? it was the telephone doctor . i answered itand a voice spoke . help it said . doctorhelp . theyve killed me then it sort of tailed away . whos speaking ? i said . whos speaking ? then i got a reply just a whisper it seemed foscatinesomething like thatregents court . the doctor uttered an exclamation . count foscatini . he has a flat in regents court . i must go at once . what can have happened ? a patient of yours ? asked poirot . i attended him for some slight ailment a few weeks ago . an italian but he speaks english perfectly . well i must wish you good night monsieur poirot unless he hesitated . i perceive the thought in your mind said poirot smiling . i shall be delighted to accompany you . hastings run down and get hold of a taxi . taxis always make themselves sought for when one is particularly pressed for time but i captured one at last and we were soon bowling along in the direction of regents park . regents court was a new block of flats situated just off st . johns wood road . they had only recently been built and contained the latest service devices . there was no one in the hall . the doctor pressed the liftbell impatiently and when the lift arrived questioned the uniformed attendant sharply . flat ii . count foscatini . theres been an accident there i understand . the man stared at him . first ive heard of it . mr . gravesthats count foscatinis manwent out about half an hour ago and he said nothing . is the count alone in the flat ? no sir hes got two gentlemen dining with him . what are they like ? i asked eagerly . we were in the lift now ascending rapidly to the second floor on which flat ii was situated . i didnt see them myself sir but i understand that they were foreign gentlemen . he pulled back the iron door and we stepped out on the landing . no . ii was opposite to us . the doctor rang the bell . there was no reply and we could hear no sound from within . the doctor rang again and again we could hear the bell trilling within but no sign of life rewarded us . this is getting serious muttered the doctor . he turned to the lift attendant . is there any passkey to this door ? there is one in the porters office downstairs . get it then and look here i think youd better send for the police . poirot approved with a nod of the head . the man returned shortly with him came the manager . will you tell me gentlemen what is the meaning of all this ? certainly . i received a telephone message from count foscatini stating that he had been attacked and was dying . you can understand that we must lose no timeif we are not already too late . the manager produced the key without more ado and we all entered the flat . we passed first into a small square lounge hall . a door on the right of it was half open . the manager indicated it with a nod . the diningroom . dr . hawker led the way . we followed close on his heels . as we entered the room i gave a gasp . the round table in the centre bore the remains of a meal three chairs were pushed back as though their occupants had just risen . in the corner to the right of the fireplace was a big writingtable and sitting at it was a manor what had been a man . his right hand still grasped the base of the telephone but he had fallen forward struck down by a terrific blow on the head from behind . the weapon was not far to seek . a marble statuette stood where it had been hurriedly put down the base of it stained with blood . the doctors examination did not take a minute . stone dead . must have been almost instantaneous . i wonder he even managed to telephone . it will be better not to move him until the police arrive . on the managers suggestion we searched the flat but the result was a foregone conclusion . it was not likely that the murderers would be concealed there when all they had to do was to walk out . we came back to the diningroom . poirot had not accompanied us in our tour . i found him studying the centre table with close attention . i joined him . it was a wellpolished round mahogany table . a bowl of roses decorated the centre and white lace mats reposed on the gleaming surface . there was a dish of fruit but the three dessert plates were untouched . there were three coffeecups with remains of coffee in themtwo black one with milk . all three men had taken port and the decanter halffull stood before the centre plate . one of the men had smoked a cigar the other two cigarettes . a tortoiseshellandsilver box holding cigars and cigarettes stood open upon the table . i enumerated all these facts to myself but i was forced to admit that they did not shed any brilliant light on the situation . i wondered what poirot saw in them to make him so intent . i asked him . mon ami he replied you miss the point . i am looking for something that i do not see . what is that ? a mistakeeven a little mistakeon the part of the murderer . he stepped swiftly to the small adjoining kitchen looked in and shook his head . monsieur he said to the manager explain to me i pray your system of serving meals here . the manager stepped to a small hatch in the wall . this is the service lift he explained . it runs to the kitchens at the top of the building . you order through this telephone and the dishes are sent down in the lift one course at a time . the dirty plates and dishes are sent up in the same manner . no domestic worries you understand and at the same time you avoid the wearying publicity of always dining in a restaurant . poirot nodded . then the plates and dishes that were used tonight are on high in the kitchen . you permit that i mount there ? oh certainly if you like roberts the lift man will take you up and introduce you but im afraid you wont find anything thats of any use . theyre handling hundreds of plates and dishes and theyll be all lumped together . poirot remained firm however and together we visited the kitchens and questioned the man who had taken the order from flat ii . the order was given from the  la carte menufor three he explained . soup julienne filet de sole normande tournedos of beef and a rice souffl . what time ? just about eight oclock i should say . no im afraid the plates and dishes have been all washed up by now . unfortunate . you were thinking of fingerprints i suppose ? not exactly said poirot with an enigmatical smile . i am more interested in count foscatinis appetite . did he partake of every dish ? yes but of course i cant say how much of each he ate . the plates were all soiled and the dishes emptythat is to say with the exception of the rice souffl . there was a fair amount of that left . ah said poirot and seemed satisfied with the fact . as we descended to the flat again he remarked in a low tone we have decidedly to do with a man of method . do you mean the murderer or count foscatini ? the latter was undoubtedly an orderly gentleman . after imploring help and announcing his approaching demise he carefully hung up the telephone receiver . i stared at poirot . his words now and his recent inquiries gave me the glimmering of an idea . you suspect poison ? i breathed . the blow on the head was a blind . poirot merely smiled . we reentered the flat to find the local inspector of police had arrived with two constables . he was inclined to resent our appearance but poirot calmed him with the mention of our scotland yard friend inspector japp and we were accorded a grudging permission to remain . it was a lucky thing we were for we had not been back five minutes before an agitated middleaged man came rushing into the room with every appearance of grief and agitation . this was graves valetbutler to the late count foscatini . the story he had to tell was a sensational one . on the previous morning two gentlemen had called to see his master . they were italians and the elder of the two a man of about forty gave his name as signor ascanio . the younger was a welldressed lad of about twentyfour . count foscatini was evidently prepared for their visit and immediately sent graves out upon some trivial errand . here the man paused and hesitated in his story . in the end however he admitted that curious as to the purport of the interview he had not obeyed immediately but had lingered about endeavouring to hear something of what was going on . the conversation was carried on in so low a tone that he was not as successful as he had hoped but he gathered enough to make it clear that some kind of monetary proposition was being discussed and that the basis of it was a threat . the discussion was anything but amicable . in the end count foscatini raised his voice slightly and the listener heard these words clearly i have no time to argue further now gentlemen . if you will dine with me tomorrow night at eight oclock we will resume the discussion . afraid of being discovered listening graves had then hurried out to do his masters errand . this evening the two men had arrived punctually at eight . during dinner they had talked of indifferent matterspolitics the weather and the theatrical world . when graves had placed the port upon the table and brought in the coffee his master told him that he might have the evening off . was that a usual proceeding of his when he had guests ? asked the inspector . no sir it wasnt . thats what made me think it must be some business of a very unusual kind that he was going to discuss with these gentlemen . that finished gravess story . he had gone out about  . and meeting a friend had accompanied him to the metropolitan music hall in edgware road . nobody had seen the two men leave but the time of the murder was fixed clearly enough at  . . a small clock on the writingtable had been swept off by foscatinis arm and had stopped at that hour which agreed with miss riders telephone summons . the police surgeon had made his examination of the body and it was now lying on the couch . i saw the face for the first timethe olive complexion the long nose the luxuriant black moustache and the full red lips drawn back from the dazzlingly white teeth . not altogether a pleasant face . well said the inspector refastening his notebook . the case seems clear enough . the only difficulty will be to lay our hands on this signor ascanio . i suppose his address is not in the dead mans pocketbook by any chance ? as poirot had said the late foscatini was an orderly man . neatly written in small precise handwriting was the inscription signor paolo ascanio grosvenor hotel . the inspector busied himself with the telephone then turned to us with a grin . just in time . our fine gentleman was off to catch the boat train to the continong . well gentlemen thats about all we can do here . its a bad business but straightforward enough . one of these italian vendetta things as likely as not . thus airily dismissed we found our way downstairs . dr . hawker was full of excitement . like the beginning of a novel eh ? real exciting stuff . wouldnt believe it if you read about it . poirot did not speak . he was very thoughtful . all the evening he had hardly opened his lips . what says the master detective eh ? asked hawker clapping him on the back . nothing to work your grey cells over this time . you think not ? what could there be ? well for example there is the window . the window ? but it was fastened . nobody could have got out or in that way . i noticed it specially . and why were you able to notice it ? the doctor looked puzzled . poirot hastened to explain . it is to the curtains i refer . they were not drawn . a little odd that . and then there was the coffee . it was very black coffee . well what of it ? very black repeated poirot . in conjunction with that let us remember that very little of the rice souffl was eaten and we getwhat ? moonshine laughed the doctor . youre pulling my leg . never do i pull the leg . hastings here knows that i am perfectly serious . i dont know what you are getting at all the same i confessed . you dont suspect the manservant do you ? he might have been in with the gang and put some dope in the coffee . i suppose theyll test his alibi ? without doubt my friend but it is the alibi of signor ascanio that interests me . you think he has an alibi ? that is just what worries me . i have no doubt that we shall soon be enlightened on that point . the daily newsmonger enabled us to become conversant with succeeding events . signor ascanio was arrested and charged with the murder of count foscatini . when arrested he denied knowing the count and declared he had never been near regents court either on the evening of the crime or on the previous morning . the younger man had disappeared entirely . signor ascanio had arrived alone at the grosvenor hotel from the continent two days before the murder . all efforts to trace the second man failed . ascanio however was not sent for trial . no less a personage than the italian ambassador himself came forward and testified at the policecourt proceedings that ascanio had been with him at the embassy from eight till nine that evening . the prisoner was discharged . naturally a lot of people thought that the crime was a political one and was being deliberately hushed up . poirot had taken a keen interest in all these points . nevertheless i was somewhat surprised when he suddenly informed me one morning that he was expecting a visitor at eleven oclock and that that visitor was none other than ascanio himself . he wishes to consult you ? du tout hastings . i wish to consult him . what about ? the regents court murder . you are going to prove that he did it ? a man cannot be tried twice for murder hastings . endeavour to have the common sense . ah that is our friends ring . a few minutes later signor ascanio was ushered ina small thin man with a secretive and furtive glance in his eyes . he remained standing darting suspicious glances from one to the other of us . monsieur poirot ? my little friend tapped himself gently on the chest . be seated signor . you received my note . i am determined to get to the bottom of this mystery . in some small measure you can aid me . let us commence . youin company with a friendvisited the late count foscatini on the morning of tuesday the th the italian made an angry gesture . i did nothing of the sort . i have sworn in court prcismentand i have a little idea that you have sworn falsely . you threaten me ? bah i have nothing to fear from you . i have been acquitted . exactly and as i am not an imbecile it is not with the gallows i threaten youbut with publicity . publicity i see that you do not like the word . i had an idea that you would not . my little ideas you know they are very valuable to me . come signor your only chance is to be frank with me . i do not ask to know whose indiscretions brought you to england . i know this much you came for the especial purpose of seeing count foscatini . he was not a count growled the italian . i have already noted the fact that his name does not appear in the almanach de gotha . never mind the title of count is often useful in the profession of blackmailing . i suppose i might as well be frank . you seem to know a good deal . i have employed my grey cells to some advantage . come signor ascanio you visited the dead man on the tuesday morningthat is so is it not ? yes but i never went there on the following evening . there was no need . i will tell you all . certain information concerning a man of great position in italy had come into this scoundrels possession . he demanded a big sum of money in return for the papers . i came over to england to arrange the matter . i called upon him by appointment that morning . one of the young secretaries of the embassy was with me . the count was more reasonable than i had hoped although even then the sum of money i paid him was a huge one . pardon how was it paid ? in italian notes of comparatively small denomination . i paid over the money then and there . he handed me the incriminating papers . i never saw him again . why did you not say all this when you were arrested ? in my delicate position i was forced to deny any association with the man . and how do you account for the events of the evening then ? i can only think that some one must have deliberately impersonated me . i understand that no money was found in the flat . poirot looked at him and shook his head . strange he murmured . we all have the little grey cells . and so few of us know how to use them . good morning signor ascanio . i believe your story . it is very much as i had imagined . but i had to make sure . after bowing his guest out poirot returned to his armchair and smiled at me . let us hear m . le capitaine hastings on the case ? well i suppose ascanio is rightsomebody impersonated him . never never will you use the brains the good god has given you . recall to yourself some words i uttered after leaving the flat that night . i referred to the windowcurtains not being drawn . we are in the month of june . it is still light at eight oclock . the light is failing by halfpast . a vous dit quelque chose ? i perceive a struggling impression that you will arrive some day . now let us continue . the coffee was as i said very black . count foscatinis teeth were magnificently white . coffee stains the teeth . we reason from that that count foscatini did not drink any coffee . yet there was coffee in all three cups . why should anyone pretend count foscatini had drunk coffee when he had not done so ? i shook my head utterly bewildered . come i will help you . what evidence have we that ascanio and his friend or two men posing as them ever came to the flat that night ? nobody saw them go in nobody saw them go out . we have the evidence of one man and of a host of inanimate objects . you mean ? i mean knives and forks and plates and empty dishes . ah but it was a clever idea graves is a thief and a scoundrel but what a man of method he overhears a portion of the conversation in the morning enough to realize that ascanio will be in awkward position to defend himself . the following evening about eight oclock he tells his master he is wanted at the telephone . foscatini sits down stretches out his hand to the telephone and from behind graves strikes him down with the marble figure . then quickly to the service telephonedinner for three it comes he lays the table dirties the plates knives and forks etc . but he has to get rid of the food too . not only is he a man of brain he has a resolute and capacious stomach but after eating three tournedos the rice souffl is too much for him he even smokes a cigar and two cigarettes to carry out the illusion . ah but it was magnificently thorough then having moved on the hands of the clock to  . he smashes it and stops it . the one thing he does not do is to draw the curtains . but if there had been a real dinner party the curtains would have been drawn as soon as the light began to fail . then he hurries out mentioning the guests to the lift man in passing . he hurries to a telephone box and as near as possible to  . rings up the doctor with his masters dying cry . so successful is his idea that no one ever inquires if a call was put through from flat ii at that time . except hercule poirot i suppose ? i said sarcastically . not even hercule poirot said my friend with a smile . i am about to inquire now . i had to prove my point to you first . but you will see i shall be right and then japp to whom i have already given a hint will be able to arrest the respectable graves . i wonder how much of the money he has spent . poirot was right . he always is confound him xi the case of the missing will the problem presented to us by miss violet marsh made rather a pleasant change from our usual routine work . poirot had received a brisk and businesslike note from the lady asking for an appointment and he had replied asking her to call upon him at eleven oclock the following day . she arrived punctuallya tall handsome young woman plainly but neatly dressed with an assured and businesslike manner . clearly a young woman who meant to get on in the world . i am not a great admirer of the socalled new woman myself and in spite of her good looks i was not particularly prepossessed in her favour . my business is of a somewhat unusual nature monsieur poirot she began after she had accepted a chair . i had better begin at the beginning and tell you the whole story . if you please mademoiselle . i am an orphan . my father was one of two brothers sons of a small yeoman farmer in devonshire . the farm was a poor one and the elder brother andrew emigrated to australia where he did very well indeed and by means of successful speculation in land became a very rich man . the younger brother roger my father had no leanings towards the agricultural life . he managed to educate himself a little and obtained a post as a clerk with a small firm . he married slightly above him my mother was the daughter of a poor artist . my father died when i was six years old . when i was fourteen my mother followed him to the grave . my only living relation then was my uncle andrew who had recently returned from australia and bought a small place crabtree manor in his native county . he was exceedingly kind to his brothers orphan child took me to live with him and treated me in every way as though i was his own daughter . crabtree manor in spite of its name is really only an old farmhouse . farming was in my uncles blood and he was intensely interested in various modern farming experiments . although kindness itself to me he had certain peculiar and deeplyrooted ideas as to the upbringing of women . himself a man of little or no education though possessing remarkable shrewdness he placed little value on what he called book knowledge . he was especially opposed to the education of women . in his opinion girls should learn practical housework and dairywork be useful about the home and have as little to do with book learning as possible . he proposed to bring me up on these lines to my bitter disappointment and annoyance . i rebelled frankly . i knew that i possessed a good brain and had absolutely no talent for domestic duties . my uncle and i had many bitter arguments on the subject for though much attached to each other we were both selfwilled . i was lucky enough to win a scholarship and up to a certain point was successful in getting my own way . the crisis arose when i resolved to go to girton . i had a little money of my own left me by my mother and i was quite determined to make the best use of the gifts god had given me . i had one long final argument with my uncle . he put the facts plainly before me . he had no other relations and he had intended me to be his sole heiress . as i have told you he was a very rich man . if i persisted in these newfangled notions of mine however i need look for nothing from him . i remained polite but firm . i should always be deeply attached to him i told him but i must lead my own life . we parted on that note . you fancy your brains my girl were his last words . ive no book learning but for all that ill pit mine against yours any day . well see what we shall see . that was nine years ago . i have stayed with him for a weekend occasionally and our relations were perfectly amicable though his views remained unaltered . he never referred to my having matriculated nor to my b .sc . for the last three years his health had been failing and a month ago he died . i am now coming to the point of my visit . my uncle left a most extraordinary will . by its terms crabtree manor and its contents are to be at my disposal for a year from his deathduring which time my clever niece may prove her wits the actual words run . at the end of that period my wits having proved better than hers the house and all my uncles large fortune pass to various charitable institutions . that is a little hard on you mademoiselle seeing that you were mr . marshs only blood relation . i do not look on it in that way . uncle andrew warned me fairly and i chose my own path . since i would not fall in with his wishes he was at perfect liberty to leave his money to whom he pleased . was the will drawn up by a lawyer ? no it was written on a printed willform and witnessed by the man and his wife who live in the house and do for my uncle . there might be a possibility of upsetting such a will ? i would not even attempt to do such a thing . you regard it then as a sporting challenge on the part of your uncle ? that is exactly how i look upon it . it bears that interpretation certainly said poirot thoughtfully . somewhere in this rambling old manorhouse your uncle has concealed either a sum of money in notes or possibly a second will and has given you a year in which to exercise your ingenuity to find it . exactly monsieur poirot and i am paying you the compliment of assuming that your ingenuity will be greater than mine . eh eh but that is very charming of you . my grey cells are at your disposal . you have made no search yourself ? only a cursory one but i have too much respect for my uncles undoubted abilities to fancy that the task will be an easy one . have you the will or a copy of it with you ? miss marsh handed a document across the table . poirot ran through it nodding to himself . made three years ago . dated march  and the time is given also a .m .that is very suggestive . it narrows the field of search . assuredly it is another will we have to seek for . a will made even halfanhour later would upset this . eh bien mademoiselle it is a problem charming and ingenious that you have presented to me here . i shall have all the pleasure in the world in solving it for you . granted that your uncle was a man of ability his grey cells cannot have been of the quality of hercule poirots really poirots vanity is blatant fortunately i have nothing of moment on hand at the minute . hastings and i will go down to crabtree manor tonight . the man and wife who attended on your uncle are still there i presume ? yes their name is baker .        the following morning saw us started on the hunt proper . we had arrived late the night before . mr . and mrs . baker having received a telegram from miss marsh were expecting us . they were a pleasant couple the man gnarled and pinkcheeked like a shrivelled pippin and his wife a woman of vast proportions and true devonshire calm . tired with our journey and the eightmile drive from the station we had retired at once to bed after a supper of roast chicken apple pie and devonshire cream . we had now disposed of an excellent breakfast and were sitting in a small panelled room which had been the late mr . marshs study and livingroom . a rolltop desk stuffed with papers all neatly docketed stood against the wall and a big leather armchair showed plainly that it had been its owners constant restingplace . a big chintzcovered settee ran along the opposite wall and the deep low window seats were covered with the same faded chintz of an oldfashioned pattern . eh bien mon ami said poirot lighting one of his tiny cigarettes we must map out our plan of campaign . already i have made a rough survey of the house but i am of opinion that any clue will be found in this room . we shall have to go through the documents in the desk with meticulous care . naturally i do not expect to find the will amongst them but it is likely that some apparently innocent paper may conceal the clue to its hidingplace . but first we must have a little information . ring the bell i pray of you . i did so . while we were waiting for it to be answered poirot walked up and down looking about him approvingly . a man of method this mr . marsh . see how neatly the packets of papers are docketed then the key to each drawer has its ivory labelso has the key of the china cabinet on the wall and see with what precision the china within is arranged . it rejoices the heart . nothing here offends the eye he came to an abrupt pause as his eye was caught by the key of the desk itself to which a dirty envelope was affixed . poirot frowned at it and withdrew it from the lock . on it were scrawled the words key of roll top desk in a crabbed handwriting quite unlike the neat superscriptions on the other keys . an alien note said poirot frowning . i could swear that here we have no longer the personality of mr . marsh . but who else has been in the house ? only miss marsh and she if i mistake not is also a young lady of method and order . baker came in answer to the bell . will you fetch madame your wife and answer a few questions ? baker departed and in a few moments returned with mrs . baker wiping her hands on her apron and beaming all over her face . in a few clear words poirot set forth the object of his mission . the bakers were immediately sympathetic . us dont want to see miss violet done out of whats hers declared the woman . cruel hard twould be for hospitals to get it all . poirot proceeded with his questions . yes mr . and mrs . baker remembered perfectly witnessing the will . baker had previously been sent into the neighbouring town to get two printed willforms . two ? said poirot sharply . yes sir for safety like i suppose in case he should spoil oneand sure enough so he did do . us had signed one what time of day was that ? baker scratched his head but his wife was quicker . why to be sure id just put the milk on for the cocoa at eleven . dont ee remember ? it had all boiled over on the stove when us got back to kitchen . and afterwards ? twould be about an hour later . us had to go in again . ive made a mistake says old master had to tear the whole thing up . ill trouble you to sign again and us did . and afterwards master give us a tidy sum of money each . ive left you nothing in my will says he but each year i live youll have this to be a nestegg when im gone and sure enough so he did . poirot reflected . after you had signed the second time what did mr . marsh do ? do you know ? went out to the village to pay tradesmens books . that did not seem very promising . poirot tried another tack . he held out the key of the desk . is that your masters writing ? i may have imagined it but i fancied that a moment or two elapsed before baker replied yes sir it is . hes lying i thought . but why ? has your master let the house ?have there been any strangers in it during the last three years ? no sir . no visitors ? only miss violet . no strangers of any kind been inside this room ? no sir . you forget the workmen jim his wife reminded him . workmen ? poirot wheeled round on her . what workmen ? the woman explained that about two years and a half ago workmen had been in the house to do certain repairs . she was quite vague as to what the repairs were . her view seemed to be that the whole thing was a fad of her masters and quite unnecessary . part of the time the workmen had been in the study but what they had done there she could not say as her master had not let either of them into the room whilst the work was in progress . unfortunately they could not remember the name of the firm employed beyond the fact that it was a plymouth one . we progress hastings said poirot rubbing his hands as the bakers left the room . clearly he made a second will and then had workmen from plymouth in to make a suitable hidingplace . instead of wasting time taking up the floor and tapping the walls we will go to plymouth . with a little trouble we were able to get the information we wanted . after one or two essays we found the firm employed by mr . marsh . their employees had all been with them many years and it was easy to find the two men who had worked under mr . marshs orders . they remembered the job perfectly . amongst various other minor jobs they had taken up one of the bricks of the oldfashioned fireplace made a cavity beneath and so cut the brick that it was impossible to see the join . by pressing on the second brick from the end the whole thing was raised . it had been quite a complicated piece of work and the old gentleman had been very fussy about it . our informant was a man called coghan a big gaunt man with a grizzled moustache . he seemed an intelligent fellow . we returned to crabtree manor in high spirits and locking the study door proceeded to put our newly acquired knowledge into effect . it was impossible to see any sign on the bricks but when we pressed in the manner indicated a deep cavity was at once disclosed . eagerly poirot plunged in his hand . suddenly his face fell from complacent elation to consternation . all he held was a charred fragment of stiff paper . but for it the cavity was empty . sacr cried poirot angrily . some one has been before us . we examined the scrap of paper anxiously . clearly it was a fragment of what we sought . a portion of bakers signature remained but no indication of what the terms of the will had been . poirot sat back on his heels . his expression would have been comical if we had not been so overcome . i understand it not he growled . who destroyed this ? and what was their object ? the bakers ? i suggested . pourquoi ? neither will makes any provision for them and they are more likely to be kept on with miss marsh than if the place became the property of a hospital . how could it be to anyones advantage to destroy the will ? the hospitals benefityes but one cannot suspect institutions . perhaps the old man changed his mind and destroyed it himself i suggested . poirot rose to his feet dusting his knees with his usual care . that may be he admitted . one of your more sensible observations hastings . well we can do no more here . we have done all that mortal man can do . we have successfully pitted our wits against the late andrew marshs but unfortunately his niece is no better off for our success . by driving to the station at once we were just able to catch a train to london though not the principal express . poirot was sad and dissatisfied . for my part i was tired and dozed in a corner . suddenly as we were just moving out of taunton poirot uttered a piercing squeal . vite hastings awake and jump but jump i say before i knew where i was we were standing on the platform bareheaded and minus our valises whilst the train disappeared into the night . i was furious . but poirot paid no attention . imbecile that i have been he cried . triple imbecile not again will i vaunt my little grey cells thats a good job at any rate i said grumpily . but what is this all about ? as usual when following out his own ideas poirot paid absolutely no attention to me . the tradesmens booksi have left them entirely out of account yes but where ? where ? never mind i cannot be mistaken . we must return at once . easier said than done . we managed to get a slow train to exeter and there poirot hired a car . we arrived back at crabtree manor in the small hours of the morning . i pass over the bewilderment of the bakers when we had at last aroused them . paying no attention to anybody poirot strode at once to the study . i have been not a triple imbecile but thirtysix times one my friend he deigned to remark . now behold going straight to the desk he drew out the key and detached the envelope from it . i stared at him stupidly . how could he possibly hope to find a big willform in that tiny envelope ? with great care he cut open the envelope laying it out flat . then he lighted the fire and held the plain inside surface of the envelope to the flame . in a few minutes faint characters began to appear . look mon ami cried poirot in triumph . i looked . there were just a few lines of faint writing stating briefly that he left everything to his niece violet marsh . it was dated march   . p .m . and witnessed by albert pike confectioner and jessie pike married woman . but is it legal ? i gasped . as far as i know there is no law against writing your will in a blend of disappearing and sympathetic ink . the intention of the testator is clear and the beneficiary is his only living relation . but the cleverness of him he foresaw every step that a searcher would takethat i miserable imbecile took . he gets two willforms makes the servants sign twice then sallies out with his will written on the inside of a dirty envelope and a fountainpen containing his little ink mixture . on some excuse he gets the confectioner and his wife to sign their names under his own signature then he ties it to the key of his desk and chuckles to himself . if his niece sees through his little ruse she will have justified her choice of life and elaborate education and be thoroughly welcome to his money . she didnt see through it did she ? i said slowly . it seems rather unfair . the old man really won . but no hastings . it is your wits that go astray . miss marsh proved the astuteness of her wits and the value of the higher education for women by at once putting the matter in my hands . always employ the expert . she has amply proved her right to the money . i wonderi very much wonderwhat old andrew marsh would have thought the end end of the project gutenberg ebook of poirot investigates by agatha christie  end of the

capturing long-term dependencies, leading to fluctuating ROUGE scores.\n","- In contrast, ChatGPT performs more consistently due to the transformer architecture, which handles longer-range context more effectively.\n","- Additionally, training the model with punctuation provides clearer segmentation, which slightly improves text coherence and ROUGE scores. However,using more complex tokenization might help by allowing the model to better handle rare words, subwords, and punctuation, which could lead to more consistent and accurate text generation.\n","- The difference prompt to ChatGPT will provide the different generated text result. The initial prompt yielded general information, while the second prompt requesting an Agatha Christie style produced a literary response. This shows that ChatGPT has learned from lots of different kinds of writing.\n","- Therefore, providing more training data, especially data with different styles and types of writing could help the model better recognize text patterns and successfully generate text that is closer to human-level sentences"],"metadata":{"id":"Y950LZvB_EaT"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 6.

the case of the missing will   poirot investigates   poirot investigates   i   the adventure of the western star i was standing at the window of poirots rooms looking out idly on the street below thats queer i ejaculated suddenly beneath my breath what is mon ami asked poirot placidly from the depths of his comfortable chair deduce poirot from the following facts here is a young lady richly dressedfashionable hat magnificent furs she is coming along slowly looking up at the houses as she goes unknown to her she is being shadowed by three men and a middleaged woman they have just been joined by an errand boy who points after the girl gesticulating as he does so what drama is this being played is the girl a crook and are the shadowers detectives preparing to arrest her or are they the scoundrels and are they plotting to attack an innocent victim what does the great detective say the great detective mon ami chooses as ever the simplest course he rises to see for himself and my friend joined me at the window in a minute he gave vent to an amused chuckle as usual your facts are tinged with your incurable romanticism that is miss mary marvell the film star she is being followed by a bevy of admirers who have recognized her and en passant my dear hastings she is quite aware of the fact i laughed so all is explained but you get no marks for that poirot it was a mere matter of recognition en vrit and how many times have you seen mary marvell on the screen mon cher i thought about a dozen times perhaps and ionce yet i recognize her and you do not she looks so different i replied rather feebly ah sacr cried poirot is it that you expect her to promenade herself in the streets of london in a cowboy hat or with bare feet and a bunch of curls as an irish colleen always with you it is the nonessentials remember the case of the dancer valerie saintclair i shrugged my shoulders slightly annoyed but console yourself mon ami said poirot calming down all cannot be as hercule poirot i know it well you really have the best opinion of yourself of anyone i ever knew i cried divided between amusement and annoyance what will you when one is unique one knows it and others share that opinioneven if i mistake not miss mary marvell what without doubt she is coming here how do you make that out very simply this street it is not aristocratic mon ami in it there is no fashionable doctor no fashionable dentiststill less is there a fashionable milliner but there is a fashionable detective oui my friend it is truei am become the mode the dernier cri one says to another comment you have lost your gold pencilcase you must go to the little belgian he is too marvellous every one goes courez and they arrive in flocks mon ami with problems of the most foolish a bell rang below what did i tell you that is miss marvell as usual poirot was right after a short interval the american film star was ushered in and we rose to our feet mary marvell was undoubtedly one of the most popular actresses on the screen she had only lately arrived in england in company with her husband gregory b rolf also a film actor their marriage had taken place about a year ago in the states and this was their first visit to england they had been given a great reception every one was prepared to go mad over mary marvell her wonderful clothes her furs her jewels above all one jewel the great diamond which had been nicknamed to match its owner the western star much true and untrue had been written about this famous stone which was reported to be insured for the enormous sum of fifty thousand pounds all these details passed rapidly through my mind as i joined with poirot in greeting our fair client miss marvell was small and slender very fair and girlishlooking with the wide innocent blue eyes of a child poirot drew forward a chair for her and she commenced talking at once you will probably think me very foolish monsieur poirot but lord cronshaw was telling me last night how wonderfully you cleared up the mystery of his nephews death and i felt that i just must have your advice i dare say its only a silly hoaxgregory says sobut its just worrying me to death she paused for breath poirot beamed encouragement proceed madame you comprehend i am still in the dark its these letters miss marvell unclasped her handbag and drew out three envelopes which she handed to poirot the latter scrutinized them closely cheap paperthe name and address carefully printed let us see the inside he drew out the enclosure i had joined him and was leaning over his shoulder the writing consisted of a single sentence carefully printed like the envelope it ran as follows the great diamond which is the left eye of the god must return whence it came the second letter was couched in precisely the same terms but the third was more explicit you have been warned you have not obeyed now the diamond will be taken from you at the full of the moon the two diamonds which are the left and right eye of the god shall return so it is written the first letter i treated as a joke explained miss marvell when i got the second i began to wonder the third one came yesterday and it seemed to me that after all the matter might be more serious than i had imagined i see they did not come by post these letters no they were left by handby a chinaman that is what frightens me why because it was from a chink in san francisco that gregory bought the stone three years ago i see madame that you believe the diamond referred to to be the western star finished miss marvell thats so at the time gregory remembers that there was some story attached to the stone but the chink wasnt handing out any information gregory says he seemed just scared to death and in a mortal hurry to get rid of the thing he only asked about a tenth of its value it was gregs wedding present to me poirot nodded thoughtfully the story seems of an almost unbelievable romanticism and yetwho knows i pray of you hastings hand me my little almanac i complied voyons said poirot turning the leaves when is the date of the full moon ah friday next that is in three days time eh bien madame you seek my advicei give it to you this belle histoire may be a hoaxbut it may not therefore i counsel you to place the diamond in my keeping until after friday next then we can take what steps we please a slight cloud passed over the actresss face and she replied constrainedly im afraid thats impossible you have it with youhein poirot was watching her narrowly the girl hesitated a moment then slipped her hand into the bosom of her gown drawing out a long thin chain she leaned forward unclosing her hand in the palm a stone of white fire exquisitely set in platinum lay and winked at us solemnly poirot drew in his breath with a long hiss patant he murmured you permit madame he took the jewel in his own hand and scrutinized it keenly then restored it to her with a little bow a magnificent stonewithout a flaw ah cent tonnerres and you carry it about with you comme a no no im very careful really monsieur poirot as a rule its locked up in my jewelcase and left in the hotel safe deposit were staying at the magnificent you know i just brought it along today for you to see and you will leave it with me nestce pas you will be advised by papa poirot well you see its this way monsieur poirot on friday were going down to yardly chase to spend a few days with lord and lady yardly her words awoke a vague echo of remembrance in my mind some gossipwhat was it now a few years ago lord and lady yardly had paid a visit to the states rumour had it that his lordship had rather gone the pace out there with the assistance of some lady friendsbut surely there was something more some gossip which coupled lady yardlys name with that of a movie star in californiawhy it came to me in a flashof course it was none other than gregory b rolf ill let you into a little secret monsieur poirot miss marvell was continuing weve got a deal on with lord yardly theres some chance of our arranging to film a play down there in his ancestral pile at yardly chase i cried interested why its one of the show places of england miss marvell nodded i guess its the real old feudal stuff all right but he wants a pretty stiff price and of course i dont know yet whether the deal will go through but greg and i always like to combine business with pleasure buti demand pardon if i am dense madamesurely it is possible to visit yardly chase without taking the diamond with you a shrewd hard look came into miss marvells eyes which belied their childlike appearance she looked suddenly a good deal older i want to wear it down there surely i said suddenly there are some very famous jewels in the yardly collection a large diamond amongst them thats so said miss marvell briefly i heard poirot murmur beneath his breath ah cest comme a then he said aloud with his usual uncanny luck in hitting the bullseye he dignifies it by the name of psychology then you are without doubt already acquainted with lady yardly or perhaps your husband is gregory knew her when she was out west three years ago said miss marvell she hesitated a moment and then added abruptly do either of you ever see society gossip we both pleaded guilty rather shamefacedly i ask because in this weeks number there is an article on famous jewels and its really very curious she broke off i rose went to the table at the other side of the room and returned with the paper in question in my hand she took it from me found the article and began to read aloud    amongst other famous stones may be included the star of the east a diamond in the possession of the yardly family an ancestor of the present lord yardly brought it back with him from china and a romantic story is said to attach to it according to this the stone was once the right eye of a temple god another diamond exactly similar in form and size formed the left eye and the story goes that this jewel too would in course of time be stolen one eye shall go west the other east till they shall meet once more then in triumph shall they return to the god it is a curious coincidence that there is at the present time a stone corresponding closely in description with this one and known as the star of the west or the western star it is the property of the celebrated film actress miss mary marvell a comparison of the two stones would be interesting she stopped patant murmured poirot without doubt a romance of the first water he turned to mary marvell and you are not afraid madame you have no superstitious terrors you do not fear to introduce these two siamese twins to each other lest a chinaman should appear and hey presto whisk them both back to china his tone was mocking but i fancied that an undercurrent of seriousness lay beneath it i dont believe that lady yardlys diamond is anything like as good a stone as mine said miss marvell anyway im going to see what more poirot would have said i do not know for at that moment the door flew open and a splendidlooking man strode into the room from his crisply curling black head to the tips of his patentleather boots he was a hero fit for romance i said id call round for you mary said gregory rolf and here i am well what does monsieur poirot say to our little problem just one big hoax same as i do poirot smiled up at the big actor they made a ridiculous contrast hoax or no hoax mr rolf he said dryly i have advised madame your wife not to take the jewel with her to yardly chase on friday im with you there sir ive already said so to mary but there shes a woman through and through and i guess she cant bear to think of another woman outshining her in the jewel line what nonsense gregory said mary marvell sharply but she flushed angrily poirot shrugged his shoulders madame i have advised i can do no more cest fini he bowed them both to the door ah la la he observed returning histoire de femmes the good husband he hit the nail on the headtout de mme he was not tactful assuredly not i imparted to him my vague remembrances and he nodded vigorously so i thought all the same there is something curious underneath all this with your permission mon ami i will take the air await my return i beg of you i shall not be long i was half asleep in my chair when the landlady tapped on the door and put her head in its another lady to see mr poirot sir ive told her he was out but she says as how shell wait seeing as shes come up from the country oh show her in here mrs murchison perhaps i can do something for her in another moment the lady had been ushered in my heart gave a leap as i recognized her lady yardlys portrait had figured too often in the society papers to allow her to remain unknown do sit down lady yardly i said drawing forward a chair my friend poirot is out but i know for a fact that hell be back very shortly she thanked me and sat down a very different type this from miss mary marvell tall dark with flashing eyes and a pale proud faceyet something wistful in the curves of the mouth i felt a desire to rise to the occasion why not in poirots presence i have frequently felt a difficultyi do not appear at my best and yet there is no doubt that i too possess the deductive sense in a marked degree i leant forward on a sudden impulse lady yardly i said i know why you have come here you have received blackmailing letters about the diamond there was no doubt as to my bolt having shot home she stared at me openmouthed all colour banished from her cheeks you know she gasped how i smiled by a perfectly logical process if miss marvell has had warning letters miss marvell she has been here she has just left as i was saying if she as the holder of one of the twin diamonds has received a mysterious series of warnings you as the holder of the other stone must necessarily have done the same you see how simple it is i am right then you have received these strange communications also for a moment she hesitated as though in doubt whether to trust me or not then she bowed her head in assent with a little smile that is so she acknowledged were yours too left by handby a chinaman no they came by post but tell me has miss marvell undergone the same experience then i recounted to her the events of the morning she listened attentively it all fits in my letters are the duplicates of hers it is true that they came by post but there is a curious perfume impregnating themsomething in the nature of jossstickthat at once suggested the east to me what does it all mean i shook my head that is what we must find out you have the letters with you we might learn something from the postmarks unfortunately i destroyed them you understand at the time i regarded it as some foolish joke can it be true that some chinese gang are really trying to recover the diamonds it seems too incredible we went over the facts again and again but could get no further towards the elucidation of the mystery at last lady yardly rose i really dont think i need wait for monsieur poirot you can tell him all this cant you thank you so much mr she hesitated her hand outstretched captain hastings of course how stupid of me youre a friend of the cavendishes arent you it was mary cavendish who sent me to monsieur poirot when my friend returned i enjoyed telling him the tale of what had occurred during his absence he crossquestioned me rather sharply over the details of our conversation and i could read between the lines that he was not best pleased to have been absent i also fancied that the dear old fellow was just the least inclined to be jealous it had become rather a pose with him to consistently belittle my abilities and i think he was chagrined at finding no loophole for criticism i was secretly rather pleased with myself though i tried to conceal the fact for fear of irritating him in spite of his idiosyncrasies i was deeply attached to my quaint little friend bien he said at length with a curious look on his face the plot develops pass me i pray you that peerage on the top shelf there he turned the leaves ah here we are yardly    th viscount served south african war    tout a na pas dimportance    mar  hon maude stopperton fourth daughter of rd baron cotteril    um um um    has iss two daughters born      clubs    residences    voil that does not tell us much but tomorrow morning we see this milord what yes i telegraphed to him i thought you had washed your hands of the case i am not acting for miss marvell since she refuses to be guided by my advice what i do now is for my own satisfactionthe satisfaction of hercule poirot decidedly i must have a finger in this pie and you calmly wire lord yardly to dash up to town just to suit your convenience he wont be pleased au contraire if i preserve for him his family diamond he ought to be very grateful then you really think there is a chance of it being stolen i asked eagerly almost a certainty replied poirot placidly everything points that way but how poirot stopped my eager questions with an airy gesture of the hand not now i pray you let us not confuse the mind and observe that peeragehow you have replaced him see you not that the tallest books go in the top shelf the next tallest in the row beneath and so on thus we have order method which as i have often told you hastings exactly i said hastily and put the offending volume in its proper place                      lord yardly turned out to be a cheery loudvoiced sportsman with a rather red face but with a goodhumoured bonhomie about him that was distinctly attractive and made up for any lack of mentality extraordinary business this monsieur poirot cant make head or tail of it seems my wifes been getting odd kind of letters and that this miss marvells had em too what does it all mean poirot handed him the copy of society gossip first milord i would ask you if these facts are substantially correct the peer took it his face darkened with anger as he read damned nonsense he spluttered theres never been any romantic story attaching to the diamond it came from india originally i believe i never heard of all this chinese god stuff still the stone is known as the star of the east well what if it is he demanded wrathfully poirot smiled a little but made no direct reply what i would ask you to do milord is to place yourself in my hands if you do so unreservedly i have great hopes of averting the catastrophe then you think theres actually something in these wildcat tales will you do as i ask you of course i will but bien then permit that i ask you a few questions this affair of yardly chase is it as you say all fixed up between you and mr rolf oh he told you about it did he no theres nothing settled he hesitated the brickred colour of his face deepening might as well get the thing straight ive made rather an ass of myself in many ways monsieur poirotand im head over ears in debtbut i want to pull up im fond of the kids and i want to straighten things up and be able to live on at the old place gregory rolf is offering me big moneyenough to set me on my feet again i dont want to do iti hate the thought of all that crowd playacting round the chasebut i may have to unless he broke off poirot eyed him keenly you have then another string to your bow permit that i make a guess it is to sell the star of the east lord yardly nodded thats it its been in the family for some generations but its not entailed still its not the easiest thing in the world to find a purchaser hoffberg the hatton garden man is on the lookout for a likely customer but hell have to find one soon or its a washout one more question permettezlady yardly which plan does she approve oh shes bitterly opposed to my selling the jewel you know what women are shes all for this film stunt i comprehend said poirot he remained a moment or so in thought then rose briskly to his feet you return to yardly chase at once bien say no word to anyoneto anyone mindbut expect us there this evening we will arrive shortly after five all right but i dont see a na pas dimportance said poirot kindly you will that i preserve for you your diamond nestce pas yes but then do as i say a sadly bewildered nobleman left the room                      it was halfpast five when we arrived at yardly chase and followed the dignified butler to the old panelled hall with its fire of blazing logs a pretty picture met our eyes lady yardly and her two children the mothers proud dark head bent down over the two fair ones lord yardly stood near smiling down on them monsieur poirot and captain hastings announced the butler lady yardly looked up with a start her husband came forward uncertainly his eyes seeking instruction from poirot the little man was equal to the occasion all my excuses it is that i investigate still this affair of miss marvells she comes to you on friday does she not i make a little tour first to make sure that all is secure also i wanted to ask of lady yardly if she recollected at all the postmarks on the letters she received lady yardly shook her head regretfully im afraid i dont it is stupid of me but you see i never dreamt of taking them seriously youll stay the night said lord yardly oh milord i fear to incommode you we have left our bags at the inn thats all right lord yardly had his cue well send down for them no nono trouble i assure you poirot permitted himself to be persuaded and sitting down by lady yardly began to make friends with the children in a short time they were all romping together and had dragged me into the game vous tes bonne mre said poirot with a gallant little bow as the children were removed reluctantly by a stern nurse lady yardly smoothed her ruffled hair i adore them she said with a little catch in her voice and they youwith reason poirot bowed again a dressinggong sounded and we rose to go up to our rooms at that moment the butler entered with a telegram on a salver which he handed to lord yardly the latter tore it open with a brief word of apology as he read it he stiffened visibly with an ejaculation he handed it to his wife then he glanced at my friend just a minute monsieur poirot i feel you ought to know about this its from hoffberg he thinks hes found a customer for the diamondan american sailing for the states tomorrow theyre sending down a chap tonight to vet the stone by jove though if this goes through words failed him lady yardly had turned away she still held the telegram in her hand i wish you wouldnt sell it george she said in a low voice its been in the family so long she waited as though for a reply but when none came her face hardened she shrugged her shoulders i must go and dress i suppose i had better display the goods she turned to poirot with a slight grimace its one of the most hideous necklaces that was ever designed george has always promised to have the stones reset for me but its never been done she left the room half an hour later we three were assembled in the great drawingroom awaiting the lady it was already a few minutes past the dinner hour suddenly there was a low rustle and lady yardly appeared framed in the doorway a radiant figure in a long white shimmering dress round the column of her neck was a rivulet of fire she stood there with one hand just touching the necklace behold the sacrifice she said gaily her illhumour seemed to have vanished wait while i turn the big light on and you shall feast your eyes on the ugliest necklace in england the switches were just outside the door as she stretched out her hand to them the incredible thing happened suddenly without any warning every light was extinguished the door banged and from the other side of it came a longdrawn piercing womans scream my god cried lord yardly that was maudes voice what has happened we rushed blindly for the door cannoning into each other in the darkness it was some minutes before we could find it what a sight met our eyes lady yardly lay senseless on the marble floor a crimson mark on her white throat where the necklace had been wrenched from her neck as we bent over her uncertain for the moment whether she were dead or alive her eyelids opened the chinaman she whispered painfully the chinamanthe side door lord yardly sprang up with an oath i accompanied him my heart beating wildly the chinaman again the side door in question was a small one in the angle of the wall not more than a dozen yards from the scene of the tragedy as we reached it i gave a cry there just short of the threshold lay the glittering necklace evidently dropped by the thief in the panic of his flight i swooped joyously down on it then i uttered another cry which lord yardly echoed for in the middle of the necklace was a great gap the star of the east was missing that settles it i breathed these were no ordinary thieves this one stone was all they wanted but how did the fellow get in through this door but its always locked i shook my head its not locked now see i pulled it open as i spoke as i did so something fluttered to the ground i picked it up it was a piece of silk and the embroidery was unmistakable it had been torn from a chinamans robe in his haste it caught in the door i explained come hurry he cannot have gone far as yet but in vain we hunted and searched in the pitch darkness of the night the thief had found it easy to make his getaway we returned reluctantly and lord yardly sent off one of the footmen posthaste to fetch the police lady yardly aptly ministered to by poirot who is as good as a woman in these matters was sufficiently recovered to be able to tell her story i was just going to turn on the other light she said when a man sprang on me from behind he tore my necklace from my neck with such force that i fell headlong to the floor as i fell i saw him disappearing through the side door then i realized by the pigtail and the embroidered robe that he was a chinaman she stopped with a shudder the butler reappeared he spoke in a low voice to lord yardly a gentleman from mr hoffbergs mlord he says you expect him good heavens cried the distracted nobleman i must see him i suppose no not here mullings in the library i drew poirot aside look here my dear fellow hadnt we better get back to london you think so hastings why welli coughed delicatelythings havent gone very well have they i mean you tell lord yardly to place himself in your hands and all will be welland then the diamond vanishes from under your very nose true said poirot rather crestfallen it was not one of my most striking triumphs this way of describing events almost caused me to smile but i stuck to my guns so havingpardon the expressionrather made a mess of things dont you think it would be more graceful to leave immediately and the dinner the without doubt excellent dinner that the chef of lord yardly has prepared oh whats dinner i said impatiently poirot held up his hands in horror mon dieu it is that in this country you treat the affairs gastronomic with a criminal indifference theres another reason why we should get back to london as soon as possible i continued what is that my friend the other diamond i said lowering my voice miss marvells eh bien what of it dont you see his unusual obtuseness annoyed me what had happened to his usually keen wits theyve got one now theyll go for the other tiens cried poirot stepping back a pace and regarding me with admiration but your brain marches to a marvel my friend figure to yourself that for the moment i had not thought of that but there is plenty of time the full of the moon it is not until friday i shook my head dubiously the full of the moon theory left me entirely cold i had my way with poirot however and we departed immediately leaving behind us a note of explanation and apology for lord yardly my idea was to go at once to the magnificent and relate to miss marvell what had occurred but poirot vetoed the plan and insisted that the morning would be time enough i gave in rather grudgingly in the morning poirot seemed strangely disinclined to stir out i began to suspect that having made a mistake to start with he was singularly loath to proceed with the case in answer to my persuasions he pointed out with admirable common sense that as the details of the affair at yardly chase were already in the morning papers the rolfs would know quite as much as we could tell them i gave way unwillingly events proved my forebodings to be justified about two oclock the telephone rang poirot answered it he listened for some moments then with a brief bien jy serai he rang off and turned to me what do you think mon ami he looked half ashamed half excited the diamond of miss marvell it has been stolen what i cried springing up and what about the full of the moon now poirot hung his head when did this happen this morning i understand i shook my head sadly if only you had listened to me you see i was right it appears so mon ami said poirot cautiously appearances are deceptive they say but it certainly appears so as we hurried in a taxi to the magnificent i puzzled out the true inwardness of the scheme that full of the moon idea was clever the whole point of it was to get us to concentrate on the friday and so be off our guard beforehand it is a pity you did not realize that ma foi said poirot airily his nonchalance quite restored after its brief eclipse one cannot think of everything i felt sorry for him he did so hate failure of any kind cheer up i said consolingly better luck next time at the magnificent we were ushered at once into the managers office gregory rolf was there with two men from scotland yard a palefaced clerk sat opposite them rolf nodded to us as we entered were getting to the bottom of it he said but its almost unbelievable how the guy had the nerve i cant think a very few minutes sufficed to give us the facts mr rolf had gone out of the hotel at  at  a gentleman so like him in appearance as to pass muster entered the hotel and demanded the jewelcase from the safe deposit he duly signed the receipt remarking carelessly as he did so looks a bit different from my ordinary one but i hurt my hand getting out of the taxi the clerk merely smiled and remarked that he saw very little difference rolf laughed and said well dont run me in as a crook this time anyway ive been getting threatening letters from a chinaman and the worst of it is i look rather like a chink myselfits something about the eyes i looked at him said the clerk who was telling us this and i saw at once what he meant the eyes slanted up at the corners like an orientals id never noticed it before darn it all man roared gregory rolf leaning forward do you notice it now the man looked up at him and started no sir he said i cant say i do and indeed there was nothing even remotely oriental about the frank brown eyes that looked into ours the scotland yard man grunted bold customer thought the eyes might be noticed and took the bull by the horns to disarm suspicion he must have watched you out of the hotel sir and nipped in as soon as you were well away what about the jewelcase i asked it was found in a corridor of the hotel only one thing had been takenthe western star we stared at each otherthe whole thing was so bizarre so unreal poirot hopped briskly to his feet i have not been of much use i fear he said regretfully is it permitted to see madame i guess shes prostrated with the shock explained rolf then perhaps i might have a few words alone with you monsieur certainly in about five minutes poirot reappeared now my friend he said gaily to a post office i have to send a telegram who to lord yardly he discounted further inquiries by slipping his arm through mine come come mon ami i know all that you feel about this miserable business i have not distinguished myself you in my place might have distinguished yourself bien all is admitted let us forget it and have lunch it was about four oclock when we entered poirots rooms a figure rose from a chair by the window it was lord yardly he looked haggard and distraught i got your wire and came up at once look here ive been round to hoffberg and they know nothing about that man of theirs last night or the wire either do you think that poirot held up his hand my excuses i sent that wire and hired the gentleman in question youbut why what the nobleman spluttered impotently my little idea was to bring things to a head explained poirot placidly bring things to a head oh my god cried lord yardly and the ruse succeeded said poirot cheerfully therefore milord i have much pleasure in returning youthis with a dramatic gesture he produced a glittering object it was a great diamond the star of the east gasped lord yardly but i dont understand no said poirot it makes no matter believe me it was necessary for the diamond to be stolen i promised you that it should be preserved to you and i have kept my word you must permit me to keep my little secret convey i beg of you the assurances of my deepest respect to lady yardly and tell her how pleased i am to be able to restore her jewel to her what beau temps is it not good day milord and smiling and talking the amazing little man conducted the bewildered nobleman to the door he returned gently rubbing his hands poirot i said am i quite demented no mon ami but you are as always in a mental fog how did you get the diamond from mr rolf rolf mais oui the warning letters the chinaman the article in society gossip all sprang from the ingenious brain of mr rolf the two diamonds supposed to be so miraculously alikebah they did not exist there was only one diamond my friend originally in the yardly collection for three years it has been in the possession of mr rolf he stole it this morning with the assistance of a touch of grease paint at the corner of each eye ah i must see him on the film he is indeed an artist celuil but why should he steal his own diamond i asked puzzled for many reasons to begin with lady yardly was getting restive lady yardly you comprehend she was left much alone in california her husband was amusing himself elsewhere mr rolf was handsome he had an air about him of romance but au fond he is very businesslike ce monsieur he made love to lady yardly and then he blackmailed her i taxed the lady with the truth the other night and she admitted it she swore that she had only been indiscreet and i believe her but undoubtedly rolf had letters of hers that could be twisted to bear a different interpretation terrified by the threat of a divorce and the prospect of being separated from her children she agreed to all he wished she had no money of her own and she was forced to permit him to substitute a paste replica for the real stone the coincidence of the date of the appearance of the western star struck me at once all goes well lord yardly prepares to range himselfto settle down and then comes the menace of the possible sale of the diamond the substitution will be discovered without doubt she writes off frantically to gregory rolf who has just arrived in england he soothes her by promising to arrange alland prepares for a double robbery in this way he will quiet the lady who might conceivably tell all to her husband an affair which would not suit our blackmailer at all he will have  insurance money aha you had forgotten that and he will still have the diamond at this point i put my finger in the pie the arrival of a diamond expert is announced lady yardly as i felt sure she would immediately arranges a robberyand does it very well too but hercule poirot he sees nothing but facts what happens in actuality the lady switches off the light bangs the door throws the necklace down the passage and screams she has already wrenched out the diamond with pliers upstairs but we saw the necklace round her neck i objected i demand pardon my friend her hand concealed the part of it where the gap would have shown to place a piece of silk in the door beforehand is childs play of course as soon as rolf read of the robbery he arranged his own little comedy and very well he played it what did you say to him i asked with lively curiosity i said to him that lady yardly had told her husband all that i was empowered to recover the jewel and that if it were not immediately handed over proceedings would be taken also a few more little lies which occurred to me he was as wax in my hands i pondered the matter it seems a little unfair on mary marvell she has lost her diamond through no fault of her own bah said poirot brutally she has a magnificent advertisement that is all she cares for that one now the other she is different bonne mre trs femme yes i said doubtfully hardly sharing poirots views on femininity i suppose it was rolf who sent her the duplicate letters pas du tout said poirot briskly she came by the advice of mary cavendish to seek my aid in her dilemma then she heard that mary marvell whom she knew to be her enemy had been here and she changed her mind jumping at a pretext that you my friend offered her a very few questions sufficed to show me that you told her of the letters not she you she jumped at the chance your words offered i dont believe it i cried stung si si mon ami it is a pity that you study not the psychology she told you that the letters were destroyed oh la la never does a woman destroy a letter if she can avoid it not even if it would be more prudent to do so its all very well i said my anger rising but youve made a perfect fool of me from beginning to end no its all very well to try and explain it away afterwards there really is a limit but you were so enjoying yourself my friend i had not the heart to shatter your illusions its no good youve gone a bit too far this time mon dieu but how you enrage yourself for nothing mon ami im fed up i went out banging the door poirot had made an absolute laughingstock of me i decided that he needed a sharp lesson i would let some time elapse before i forgave him he had encouraged me to make a perfect fool of myself   ii   the tragedy at marsdon manor i had been called away from town for a few days and on my return found poirot in the act of strapping up his small valise a la bonne heure hastings i feared you would not have returned in time to accompany me you are called away on a case then yes though i am bound to admit that on the face of it the affair does not seem promising the northern union insurance company have asked me to investigate the death of a mr maltravers who a few weeks ago insured his life with them for the large sum of fifty thousand pounds yes i said much interested there was of course the usual suicide clause in the policy in the event of his committing suicide within a year the premiums would be forfeited mr maltravers was duly examined by the companys own doctor and although he was a man slightly past the prime of life was passed as being in quite sound health however on wednesday lastthe day before yesterdaythe body of mr maltravers was found in the grounds of his house in essex marsdon manor and the cause of his death is described as some kind of internal hmorrhage that in itself would be nothing remarkable but sinister rumours as to mr maltravers financial position have been in the air of late and the northern union have ascertained beyond any possible doubt that the deceased gentleman stood upon the verge of bankruptcy now that alters matters considerably maltravers had a beautiful young wife and it is suggested that he got together all the ready money he could for the purpose of paying the premiums on a life insurance for his wifes benefit and then committed suicide such a thing is not uncommon in any case my friend alfred wright who is a director of the northern union has asked me to investigate the facts of the case but as i told him i am not very hopeful of success if the cause of the death had been heart failure i should have been more sanguine heart failure may always be translated as the inability of the local gp to discover what his patient really did die of but a hmorrhage seems fairly definite still we can but make some necessary inquiries five minutes to pack your bag hastings and we will take a taxi to liverpool street about an hour later we alighted from a great eastern train at the little station of marsdon leigh inquiries at the station yielded the information that marsdon manor was about a mile distant poirot decided to walk and we betook ourselves along the main street what is our plan of campaign i asked first i will call upon the doctor i have ascertained that there is only one doctor in marsdon leigh dr ralph bernard ah here we are at his house the house in question was a kind of superior cottage standing back a little from the road a brass plate on the gate bore the doctors name we passed up the path and rang the bell we proved to be fortunate in our call it was the doctors consulting hour and for the moment there were no patients waiting for him dr bernard was an elderly man highshouldered and stooping with a pleasant vagueness of manner poirot introduced himself and explained the purpose of our visit adding that insurance companies were bound to investigate fully in a case of this kind of course of course said dr bernard vaguely i suppose as he was such a rich man his life was insured for a big sum you consider him a rich man doctor the doctor looked rather surprised was he not he kept two cars you know and marsdon manor is a pretty big place to keep up although i believe he bought it very cheap i understand that he had had considerable losses of late said poirot watching the doctor narrowly the latter however merely shook his head sadly is that so indeed it is fortunate for his wife then that there is this life insurance a very beautiful and charming young creature but terribly unstrung by this sad catastrophe a mass of nerves poor thing i have tried to spare her all i can but of course the shock was bound to be considerable you had been attending mr maltravers recently my dear sir i never attended him what i understand mr maltravers was a christian scientistor something of that kind but you examined the body certainly i was fetched by one of the undergardeners and the cause of death was clear absolutely there was blood on the lips but most of the bleeding must have been internal was he still lying where he had been found yes the body had not been touched he was lying at the edge of a small plantation he had evidently been out shooting rooks a small rook rifle lay beside him the hmorrhage must have occurred quite suddenly gastric ulcer without a doubt no question of his having been shot eh my dear sir i demand pardon said poirot humbly but if my memory is not at fault in the case of a recent murder the doctor first gave a verdict of heart failurealtering it when the local constable pointed out that there was a bullet wound through the head you will not find any bullet wounds on the body of mr maltravers said dr bernard dryly now gentlemen if there is nothing further we took the hint good morning and many thanks to you doctor for so kindly answering our questions by the way you saw no need for an autopsy certainly not the doctor became quite apoplectic the cause of death was clear and in my profession we see no need to distress unduly the relatives of a dead patient and turning the doctor slammed the door sharply in our faces and what do you think of dr bernard hastings inquired poirot as we proceeded on our way to the manor rather an old ass exactly your judgments of character are always profound my friend i glanced at him uneasily but he seemed perfectly serious a twinkle however came into his eye and he added slyly that is to say when there is no question of a beautiful woman i looked at him coldly on our arrival at the manorhouse the door was opened to us by a middleaged parlourmaid poirot handed her his card and a letter from the insurance company for mrs maltravers she showed us into a small morningroom and retired to tell her mistress about ten minutes elapsed and then the door opened and a slender figure in widows weeds stood upon the threshold monsieur poirot she faltered madame poirot sprang gallantly to his feet and hastened towards her i cannot tell you how i regret to derange you in this way but what will you les affairesthey know no mercy mrs maltravers permitted him to lead her to a chair her eyes were red with weeping but the temporary disfigurement could not conceal her extraordinary beauty she was about twentyseven or eight and very fair with large blue eyes and a pretty pouting mouth it is something about my husbands insurance is it but must i be bothered nowso soon courage my dear madame courage you see your late husband insured his life for rather a large sum and in such a case the company always has to satisfy itself as to a few details they have empowered me to act for them you can rest assured that i will do all in my power to render the matter not too unpleasant for you will you recount to me briefly the sad events of wednesday i was changing for tea when my maid came upone of the gardeners had just run to the house he had found her voice trailed away poirot pressed her hand sympathetically i comprehend enough you had seen your husband earlier in the afternoon not since lunch i had walked down to the village for some stamps and i believe he was out pottering round the grounds shooting rooks eh yes he usually took his little rook rifle with him and i heard one or two shots in the distance where is this little rook rifle now in the hall i think she led the way out of the room and found and handed the little weapon to poirot who examined it cursorily two shots fired i see he observed as he handed it back and now madame if i might see he paused delicately the servant shall take you she murmured averting her head the parlourmaid summoned led poirot upstairs i remained with the lovely and unfortunate woman it was hard to know whether to speak or remain silent i essayed one or two general reflections to which she responded absently and in a very few minutes poirot rejoined us i thank you for all your courtesy madame i do not think you need be troubled any further with this matter by the way do you know anything of your husbands financial position she shook her head nothing whatever i am very stupid over business things i see then you can give us no clue as to why he suddenly decided to insure his life he had not done so previously i understand well we had only been married a little over a year but as to why he insured his life it was because he had absolutely made up his mind that he would not live long he had a strong premonition of his own death i gather that he had had one hmorrhage already and that he knew that another one would prove fatal i tried to dispel these gloomy fears of his but without avail alas he was only too right tears in her eyes she bade us a dignified farewell poirot made a characteristic gesture as we walked down the drive together eh bien that is that back to london my friend there appears to be no mouse in this mousehole and yet yet what a slight discrepancy that is all you noticed it you did not still life is full of discrepancies and assuredly the man cannot have taken his own lifethere is no poison that would fill his mouth with blood no no i must resign myself to the fact that all here is clear and aboveboardbut who is this a tall young man was striding up the drive towards us he passed us without making any sign but i noted that he was not illlooking with a lean deeply bronzed face that spoke of life in a tropic clime a gardener who was sweeping up leaves had paused for a minute in his task and poirot ran quickly up to him tell me i pray you who is that gentleman do you know him i dont remember his name sir though i did hear it he was staying down here last week for a night tuesday it was quick mon ami let us follow him we hastened up the drive after the retreating figure a glimpse of a blackrobed figure on the terrace at the side of the house and our quarry swerved and we after him so that we were witnesses of the meeting mrs maltravers almost staggered where she stood and her face blanched noticeably you she gasped i thought you were on the seaon your way to east africa i got some news from my lawyers that detained me explained the young man my old uncle in scotland died unexpectedly and left me some money under the circumstances i thought it better to cancel my passage then i saw this bad news in the paper and i came down to see if there was anything i could do youll want some one to look after things for you a bit perhaps at that moment they became aware of our presence poirot stepped forward and with many apologies explained that he had left his stick in the hall rather reluctantly it seemed to me mrs maltravers made the necessary introduction monsieur poirot captain black a few minutes chat ensued in the course of which poirot elicited the fact that captain black was putting up at the anchor inn the missing stick not having been discovered which was not surprising poirot uttered more apologies and we withdrew we returned to the village at a great pace and poirot made a bee line for the anchor inn here we establish ourselves until our friend the captain returns he explained you notice that i emphasized the point that we were returning to london by the first train possibly you thought i meant it but noyou observed mrs maltravers face when she caught sight of this young black she was clearly taken aback and heeh bien he was very devoted did you not think so and he was here on tuesday nightthe day before mr maltravers died we must investigate the doings of captain black hastings in about half an hour we espied our quarry approaching the inn poirot went out and accosted him and presently brought him up to the room we had engaged i have been telling captain black of the mission which brings us here he explained you can understand monsieur le capitaine that i am anxious to arrive at mr maltravers state of mind immediately before his death and that at the same time i do not wish to distress mrs maltravers unduly by asking her painful questions now you were here just before the occurrence and can give us equally valuable information ill do anything i can to help you im sure replied the young soldier but im afraid i didnt notice anything out of the ordinary you see although maltravers was an old friend of my peoples i didnt know him very well myself you came downwhen tuesday afternoon i went up to town early wednesday morning as my boat sailed from tilbury about twelve oclock but some news i got made me alter my plans as i dare say you heard me explain to mrs maltravers you were returning to east africa i understand yes ive been out there ever since the wara great country exactly now what was the talk about at dinner on tuesday night oh i dont know the usual odd topics maltravers asked after my people and then we discussed the question of german reparations and then mrs maltravers asked a lot of questions about east africa and i told them one or two yarns thats about all i think thank you poirot was silent for a moment then he said gently with your permission i should like to try a little experiment you have told us all that your conscious self knows i want now to question your subconscious self psychoanalysis what said black with visible alarm oh no said poirot reassuringly you see it is like this i give you a word you answer with another and so on any word the first one you think of shall we begin all right said black slowly but he looked uneasy note down the words please hastings said poirot then he took from his pocket his big turnipfaced watch and laid it on the table beside him we will commence day there was a moments pause and then black replied night as poirot proceeded his answers came quicker name said poirot place bernard shaw tuesday dinner journey ship country uganda story lions rook rifle farm shot suicide elephant tusks money lawyers thank you captain black perhaps you could spare me a few minutes in about half an hours time certainly the young soldier looked at him curiously and wiped his brow as he got up and now hastings said poirot smiling at me as the door closed behind him you see it all do you not i dont know what you mean does that list of words tell you nothing i scrutinized it but was forced to shake my head i will assist you to begin with black answered well within the normal time limit with no pauses so we can take it that he himself has no guilty knowledge to conceal day to night and place to name are normal associations i began work with bernard which might have suggested the local doctor had he come across him at all evidently he had not after our recent conversation he gave dinner to my tuesday but journey and country were answered by ship and uganda showing clearly that it was his journey abroad that was important to him and not the one which brought him down here story recalls to him one of the lion stories he told at dinner i proceed to rook rifle and he answered with the totally unexpected word farm when i say shot he answers at once suicide the association seems clear a man he knows committed suicide with a rook rifle on a farm somewhere remember too that his mind is still on the stories he told at dinner and i think you will agree that i shall not be far from the truth if i recall captain black and ask him to repeat the particular suicide story which he told at the dinnertable on tuesday evening black was straightforward enough over the matter yes i did tell them that story now that i come to think of it chap shot himself on a farm out there did it with a rook rifle through the roof of the mouth bullet lodged in the brain doctors were no end puzzled over itthere was nothing to show except a little blood on the lips but what what has it got to do with mr maltravers you did not know i see that he was found with a rook rifle by his side you mean my story suggested to himoh but that is awful do not distress yourselfit would have been one way or another well i must get on the telephone to london poirot had a lengthy conversation over the wire and came back thoughtful he went off by himself in the afternoon and it was not till seven oclock that he announced that he could put it off no longer but must break the news to the young widow my sympathy had already gone out to her unreservedly to be left penniless and with the knowledge that her husband had killed himself to assure her future was a hard burden for any woman to bear i cherished a secret hope however that young black might prove capable of consoling her after her first grief had passed he evidently admired her enormously our interview with the lady was painful she refused vehemently to believe the facts that poirot advanced and when she was at last convinced broke down into bitter weeping an examination of the body turned our suspicions into certainty poirot was very sorry for the poor lady but after all he was employed by the insurance company and what could he do as he was preparing to leave he said gently to mrs maltravers madame you of all people should know that there are no dead what do you mean she faltered her eyes growing wide have you never taken part in any spiritualistic sances you are mediumistic you know i have been told so but you do not believe in spiritualism surely madame i have seen some strange things you know that they say in the village that this house is haunted she nodded and at that moment the parlourmaid announced that dinner was ready wont you just stay and have something to eat we accepted gratefully and i felt that our presence could not but help distract her a little from her own griefs we had just finished our soup when there was a scream outside the door and the sound of breaking crockery we jumped up the parlourmaid appeared her hand to her heart it was a manstanding in the passage poirot rushed out returning quickly there is no one there isnt there sir said the parlourmaid weakly oh it did give me a start but why she dropped her voice to a whisper i thoughti thought it was the masterit looked like im i saw mrs maltravers give a terrified start and my mind flew to the old superstition that a suicide cannot rest she thought of it too i am sure for a minute later she caught poirots arm with a scream didnt you hear that those three taps on the window thats how he always used to tap when he passed round the house the ivy i cried it was the ivy against the pane but a sort of terror was gaining on us all the parlourmaid was obviously unstrung and when the meal was over mrs maltravers besought poirot not to go at once she was clearly terrified to be left alone we sat in the little morningroom the wind was getting up and moaning round the house in an eerie fashion twice the door of the room came unlatched and the door slowly opened and each time she clung to me with a terrified gasp ah but this door it is bewitched cried poirot angrily at last he got up and shut it once more then turned the key in the lock i shall lock it so dont do that she gasped if it should come open now and even as she spoke the impossible happened the locked door slowly swung open i could not see into the passage from where i sat but she and poirot were facing it she gave one long shriek as she turned to him you saw himthere in the passage she cried he was staring down at her with a puzzled face then shook his head i saw himmy husbandyou must have seen him too madame i saw nothing you are not wellunstrung i am perfectly well ioh god suddenly without any warning the lights quivered and went out out of the darkness came three loud raps i could hear mrs maltravers moaning and theni saw the man i had seen on the bed upstairs stood there facing us gleaming with a faint ghostly light there was blood on his lips and he held his right hand out pointing suddenly a brilliant light seemed to proceed from it it passed over poirot and me and fell on mrs maltravers i saw her white terrified face and something else my god poirot i cried look at her hand her right hand its all red her own eyes fell on it and she collapsed in a heap on the floor blood she cried hysterically yes its blood i killed him i did it he was showing me and then i put my hand on the trigger and pressed save me from himsave me hes come back her voice died away in a gurgle lights said poirot briskly the lights went on as if by magic thats it he continued you heard hastings and you everett oh by the way this is mr everett rather a fine member of the theatrical profession i phoned to him this afternoon his makeup is good isnt it quite like the dead man and with a pocket torch and the necessary phosphorescence he made the proper impression i shouldnt touch her right hand if i were you hastings red paint marks so when the lights went out i clasped her hand you see by the way we mustnt miss our train inspector japp is outside the window a bad nightbut he has been able to while away the time by tapping on the window every now and then you see continued poirot as we walked briskly through the wind and rain there was a little discrepancy the doctor seemed to think the deceased was a christian scientist and who could have given him that impression but mrs maltravers but to us she represented him as being in a grave state of apprehension about his own health again why was she so taken aback by the reappearance of young black and lastly although i know that convention decrees that a woman must make a decent pretence of mourning for her husband i do not care for such heavilyrouged eyelids you did not observe them hastings no as i always tell you you see nothing well there it was there were the two possibilities did blacks story suggest an ingenious method of committing suicide to mr maltravers or did his other listener the wife see an equally ingenious method of committing murder i inclined to the latter view to shoot himself in the way indicated he would probably have had to pull the trigger with his toeor at least so i imagine now if maltravers had been found with one boot off we should almost certainly have heard of it from some one an odd detail like that would have been remembered no as i say i inclined to the view that it was a case of murder not suicide but i realized that i had not a shadow of proof in support of my theory hence the elaborate little comedy you saw played tonight even now i dont quite see all the details of the crime i said let us start from the beginning here is a shrewd and scheming woman who knowing of her husbands financial dbcle and tired of the elderly mate she has only married for his money induces him to insure his life for a large sum and then seeks for the means to accomplish her purpose an accident gives her thatthe young soldiers strange story the next afternoon when monsieur le capitaine as she thinks is on the high seas she and her husband are strolling round the grounds what a curious story that was last night she observes could a man shoot himself in such a way do show me if it is possible the poor foolhe shows her he places the end of the rifle in his mouth she stoops down and puts her finger on the trigger laughing up at him and now sir she says saucily supposing i pull the trigger and thenand then hastingsshe pulls it   iii   the adventure of the cheap flat so far in the cases which i have recorded poirots investigations have started from the central fact whether murder or robbery and have proceeded from thence by a process of logical deduction to the final triumphant unravelling in the events i am now about to chronicle a remarkable chain of circumstances led from the apparently trivial incidents which first attracted poirots attention to the sinister happenings which completed a most unusual case i had been spending the evening with an old friend of mine gerald parker there had been perhaps about half a dozen people there besides my host and myself and the talk fell as it was bound to do sooner or later wherever parker found himself on the subject of househunting in london houses and flats were parkers special hobby since the end of the war he had occupied at least half a dozen different flats and maisonnettes no sooner was he settled anywhere than he would light unexpectedly upon a new find and would forthwith depart bag and baggage his moves were nearly always accomplished at a slight pecuniary gain for he had a shrewd business head but it was sheer love of the sport that actuated him and not a desire to make money at it we listened to parker for some time with the respect of the novice for the expert then it was our turn and a perfect babel of tongues was let loose finally the floor was left to mrs robinson a charming little bride who was there with her husband i had never met them before as robinson was only a recent acquaintance of parkers talking of flats she said have you heard of our piece of luck mr parker weve got a flatat last in montagu mansions well said parker ive always said there are plenty of flatsat a price yes but this isnt at a price its dirt cheap eighty pounds a year butbut montagu mansions is just off knightsbridge isnt it big handsome building or are you talking of a poor relation of the same name stuck in the slums somewhere no its the knightsbridge one thats what makes it so wonderful wonderful is the word its a blinking miracle but there must be a catch somewhere big premium i suppose no premium no premoh hold my head somebody groaned parker but weve got to buy the furniture continued mrs robinson ah parker brisked up i knew there was a catch for fifty pounds and its beautifully furnished i give it up said parker the present occupants must be lunatics with a taste for philanthropy mrs robinson was looking a little troubled a little pucker appeared between her dainty brows it is queer isnt it you dont think thatthatthe place is haunted never heard of a haunted flat declared parker decisively no mrs robinson appeared far from convinced but there were several things about it all that struck me aswell queer for instance i suggested ah said parker our criminal experts attention is aroused unburden yourself to him mrs robinson hastings is a great unraveller of mysteries i laughed embarrassed but not wholly displeased with the rle thrust upon me oh not really queer captain hastings but when we went to the agents stosser and paulwe hadnt tried them before because they only have the expensive mayfair flats but we thought at any rate it would do no harmeverything they offered us was four and five hundred a year or else huge premiums and then just as we were going they mentioned that they had a flat at eighty but that they doubted if it would be any good our going there because it had been on their books some time and they had sent so many people to see it that it was almost sure to be takensnapped up as the clerk put itonly people were so tiresome in not letting them know and then they went on sending and people get annoyed at being sent to a place that had perhaps been let some time mrs robinson paused for some much needed breath and then continued we thanked him and said that we quite understood it would probably be no good but that we should like an order all the samejust in case and we went there straight away in a taxi for after all you never know no  was on the second floor and just as we were waiting for the lift elsie fergusonshes a friend of mine captain hastings and they are looking for a flat toocame hurrying down the stairs ahead of you for once my dear she said but its no good its already let that seemed to finish it butwell as john said the place was very cheap we could afford to give more and perhaps if we offered a premiuma horrid thing to do of course and i feel quite ashamed of telling you but you know what flathunting is i assured her that i was well aware that in the struggle for houseroom the baser side of human nature frequently triumphed over the higher and that the wellknown rule of dog eat dog always applied so we went up and would you believe it the flat wasnt let at all we were shown over it by the maid and then we saw the mistress and the thing was settled then and there immediate possession and fifty pounds for the furniture we signed the agreement next day and we are to move in tomorrow mrs robinson paused triumphantly and what about mrs ferguson asked parker lets have your deductions hastings obvious my dear watson i quoted lightly she went to the wrong flat oh captain hastings how clever of you cried mrs robinson admiringly i rather wished poirot had been there sometimes i have the feeling that he rather underestimates my capabilities                      the whole thing was rather amusing and i propounded the thing as a mock problem to poirot on the following morning he seemed interested and questioned me rather narrowly as to the rents of flats in various localities a curious story he said thoughtfully excuse me hastings i must take a short stroll when he returned about an hour later his eyes were gleaming with a peculiar excitement he laid his stick on the table and brushed the nap of his hat with his usual tender care before he spoke it is as well mon ami that we have no affairs of moment on hand we can devote ourselves wholly to the present investigation what investigation are you talking about the remarkable cheapness of your friends mrs robinsons new flat poirot you are not serious i am most serious figure to yourself my friend that the real rent of those flats is  i have just ascertained that from the landlords agents and yet this particular flat is being sublet at eighty pounds why there must be something wrong with it perhaps it is haunted as mrs robinson suggested poirot shook his head in a dissatisfied manner then again how curious it is that her friend tells her the flat is let and when she goes up behold it is not so at all but surely you agree with me that the other woman must have gone to the wrong flat that is the only possible solution you may or may not be right on that point hastings the fact still remains that numerous other applicants were sent to see it and yet in spite of its remarkable cheapness it was still in the market when mrs robinson arrived that shows that there must be something wrong about it mrs robinson did not seem to notice anything amiss very curious is it not did she impress you as being a truthful woman hastings she was a delightful creature videmment since she renders you incapable of replying to my question describe her to me then well shes tall and fair her hairs really a beautiful shade of auburn always you have had a penchant for auburn hair murmured poirot but continue blue eyes and a very nice complexion andwell thats all i think i concluded lamely and her husband oh hes quite a nice fellownothing startling dark or fair i dont knowbetwixt and between and just an ordinary sort of face poirot nodded yes there are hundreds of these average menand anyway you bring more sympathy and appreciation to your description of women do you know anything about these people does parker know them well they are just recent acquaintances i believe but surely poirot you dont think for an instant poirot raised his hand tout doucement mon ami have i said that i think anything all i say isit is a curious story and there is nothing to throw light upon it except perhaps the ladys name eh hastings her name is stella i said stiffly but i dont see poirot interrupted me with a tremendous chuckle something seemed to be amusing him vastly and stella means a star does it not famous what on earth and stars give light voil calm yourself hastings do not put on that air of injured dignity come we will go to montagu mansions and make a few inquiries i accompanied him nothing loath the mansions were a handsome block of buildings in excellent repair a uniformed porter was sunning himself on the threshold and it was to him that poirot addressed himself pardon but could you tell me if a mr and mrs robinson reside here the porter was a man of few words and apparently of a sour or suspicious disposition he hardly looked at us and grunted out no  second floor i thank you can you tell me how long they have been here six months i started forward in amazement conscious as i did so of poirots malicious grin impossible i cried you must be making a mistake six months are you sure the lady i mean is tall and fair with reddish gold hair and thats er said the porter come in the michaelmas quarter they did just six months ago he appeared to lose interest in us and retreated slowly up the hall i followed poirot outside eh bien hastings my friend demanded slyly are you so sure now that delightful women always speak the truth i did not reply poirot had steered his way into brompton road before i asked him what he was going to do and where we were going to the house agents hastings i have a great desire to have a flat in montagu mansions if i am not mistaken several interesting things will take place there before long we were fortunate in our quest no  on the fourth floor was to be let furnished at ten guineas a week poirot promptly took it for a month outside in the street again he silenced my protests but i make money nowadays why should i not indulge a whim by the way hastings have you a revolver yessomewhere i answered slightly thrilled do you think that you will need it it is quite possible the idea pleases you i see always the spectacular and romantic appeals to you the following day saw us installed in our temporary home the flat was pleasantly furnished it occupied the same position in the building as that of the robinsons but was two floors higher the day after our installation was a sunday in the afternoon poirot left the front door ajar and summoned me hastily as a bang reverberated from somewhere below look over the banisters are those your friends do not let them see you i craned my neck over the staircase thats them i declared in an ungrammatical whisper good wait awhile about half an hour later a young woman emerged in brilliant and varied clothing with a sigh of satisfaction poirot tiptoed back into the flat cest a after the master and mistress the maid the flat should now be empty what are we going to do i asked uneasily poirot had trotted briskly into the scullery and was hauling at the rope of the coallift we are about to descend after the method of the dustbins he explained cheerfully no one will observe us the sunday concert the sunday afternoon out and finally the sunday nap after the sunday dinner of englandle rosbifall these will distract attention from the doings of hercule poirot come my friend he stepped into the rough wooden contrivance and i followed him gingerly are we going to break into the flat i asked dubiously poirots answer was not too reassuring not precisely today he replied pulling on the rope we descended slowly till we reached the second floor poirot uttered an exclamation of satisfaction as he perceived that the wooden door into the scullery was open you observe never do they bolt these doors in the daytime and yet anyone could mount or descend as we have done at night yesthough not always thenand it is against that that we are going to make provision he had drawn some tools from his pocket as he spoke and at once set deftly to work his object being to arrange the bolt so that it could be pulled back from the lift the operation only occupied about three minutes then poirot returned the tools to his pocket and we reascended once more to our own domain                      on monday poirot was out all day but when he returned in the evening he flung himself into his chair with a sigh of satisfaction hastings shall i recount to you a little history a story after your own heart and which will remind you of your favourite cinema go ahead i laughed i presume that it is a true story not one of your efforts of fancy it is true enough inspector japp of scotland yard will vouch for its accuracy since it was through his kind offices that it came to my ears listen hastings a little over six months ago some important naval plans were stolen from an american government department they showed the position of some of the most important harbour defences and would be worth a considerable sum to any foreign governmentthat of japan for example suspicion fell upon a young man named luigi valdarno an italian by birth who was employed in a minor capacity in the department and who was missing at the same time as the papers whether luigi valdarno was the thief or not he was found two days later on the east side in new york shot dead the papers were not on him now for some time past luigi valdarno had been going about with a miss elsa hardt a young concert singer who had recently appeared and who lived with a brother in an apartment in washington nothing was known of the antecedents of miss elsa hardt and she disappeared suddenly about the time of valdarnos death there are reasons for believing that she was in reality an accomplished international spy who has done much nefarious work under various aliases the american secret service whilst doing their best to trace her also kept an eye upon certain insignificant japanese gentlemen living in washington they felt pretty certain that when elsa hardt had covered her tracks sufficiently she would approach the gentlemen in question one of them left suddenly for england a fortnight ago on the face of it therefore it would seem that elsa hardt is in england poirot paused and then added softly the official description of elsa hardt is height  ft  eyes blue hair auburn fair complexion nose straight no special distinguishing marks mrs robinson i gasped well there is a chance of it anyhow amended poirot also i learn that a swarthy man a foreigner of some kind was inquiring about the occupants of no  only this morning therefore mon ami i fear that you must forswear your beauty sleep tonight and join me in my allnight vigil in the flat belowarmed with that excellent revolver of yours bien entendu rather i cried with enthusiasm when shall we start the hour of midnight is both solemn and suitable i fancy nothing is likely to occur before then at twelve oclock precisely we crept cautiously into the coallift and lowered ourselves to the second floor under poirots manipulation the wooden door quickly swung inwards and we climbed into the flat from the scullery we passed into the kitchen where we established ourselves comfortably in two chairs with the door into the hall ajar now we have but to wait said poirot contentedly closing his eyes to me the waiting appeared endless i was terrified of going to sleep just when it seemed to me that i had been there about eight hoursand had as i found out afterwards in reality been exactly one hour and twenty minutesa faint scratching sound came to my ears poirots hand touched mine i rose and together we moved carefully in the direction of the hall the noise came from there poirot placed his lips to my ear outside the front door they are cutting out the lock when i give the word not before fall upon him from behind and hold him fast be careful he will have a knife presently there was a rending sound and a little circle of light appeared through the door it was extinguished immediately and then the door was slowly opened poirot and i flattened ourselves against the wall i heard a mans breathing as he passed us then he flashed on his torch and as he did so poirot hissed in my ear allez we sprang together poirot with a quick movement enveloped the intruders head with a light woollen scarf whilst i pinioned his arms the whole affair was quick and noiseless i twisted a dagger from his hand and as poirot brought down the scarf from his eyes whilst keeping it wound tightly round his mouth i jerked up my revolver where he could see it and understand that resistance was useless as he ceased to struggle poirot put his mouth close to his ear and began to whisper rapidly after a minute the man nodded then enjoining silence with a movement of the hand poirot led the way out of the flat and down the stairs our captive followed and i brought up the rear with the revolver when we were out in the street poirot turned to me there is a taxi waiting just round the corner give me the revolver we shall not need it now but if this fellow tries to escape poirot smiled he will not i returned in a minute with the waiting taxi the scarf had been unwound from the strangers face and i gave a start of surprise hes not a jap i ejaculated in a whisper to poirot observation was always your strong point hastings nothing escapes you no the man is not a jap he is an italian we got into the taxi and poirot gave the driver an address in st johns wood i was by now completely fogged i did not like to ask poirot where we were going in front of our captive and strove in vain to obtain some light upon the proceedings we alighted at the door of a small house standing back from the road a returning wayfarer slightly drunk was lurching along the pavement and almost collided with poirot who said something sharply to him which i did not catch all three of us went up the steps of the house poirot rang the bell and motioned us to stand a little aside there was no answer and he rang again and then seized the knocker which he plied for some minutes vigorously a light appeared suddenly above the fanlight and the door was opened cautiously a little way what the devil do you want a mans voice demanded harshly i want the doctor my wife is taken ill theres no doctor here the man prepared to shut the door but poirot thrust his foot in adroitly he became suddenly a perfect caricature of an infuriated frenchman what you say there is no doctor i will have the law of you you must come i will stay here and ring and knock all night my dear sir the door was opened again the man clad in a dressinggown and slippers stepped forward to pacify poirot with an uneasy glance round i will call the police poirot prepared to descend the steps no dont do that for heavens sake the man dashed after him with a neat push poirot sent him staggering down the steps in another minute all three of us were inside the door and it was pushed to and bolted quickin here poirot led the way into the nearest room switching on the light as he did so and youbehind the curtain si signor said the italian and slid rapidly behind the full folds of rosecoloured velvet which draped the embrasure of the window not a minute too soon just as he disappeared from view a woman rushed into the room she was tall with reddish hair and held a scarlet kimono round her slender form where is my husband she cried with a quick frightened glance who are you poirot stepped forward with a bow it is to be hoped your husband will not suffer from a chill i observed that he had slippers on his feet and that his dressinggown was a warm one who are you what are you doing in my house it is true that none of us have the pleasure of your acquaintance madame it is especially to be regretted as one of our number has come specially from new york in order to meet you the curtains parted and the italian stepped out to my horror i observed that he was brandishing my revolver which poirot must doubtless have put down through inadvertence in the cab the woman gave a piercing scream and turned to fly but poirot was standing in front of the closed door let me by she shrieked he will murder me who was it dat croaked luigi valdarno asked the italian hoarsely brandishing the weapon and sweeping each one of us with it we dared not move my god poirot this is awful what shall we do i cried you will oblige me by refraining from talking so much hastings i can assure you that our friend will not shoot until i give the word youse sure o dat eh said the italian leering unpleasantly it was more than i was but the woman turned to poirot like a flash what is it you want poirot bowed i do not think it is necessary to insult miss elsa hardts intelligence by telling her with a swift movement the woman snatched up a big black velvet cat which served as a cover for the telephone they are stitched in the lining of that clever murmured poirot appreciatively he stood aside from the door good evening madame i will detain your friend from new york whilst you make your getaway whatta fool roared the big italian and raising the revolver he fired pointblank at the womans retreating figure just as i flung myself upon him but the weapon merely clicked harmlessly and poirots voice rose in mild reproof never will you trust your old friend hastings i do not care for my friends to carry loaded pistols about with them and never would i permit a mere acquaintance to do so no no mon ami this to the italian who swearing hoarsely poirot continued to address him in a tone of mild reproof see now what i have done for you i have saved you from being hanged and do not think that our beautiful lady will escape no no the house is watched back and front straight into the arms of the police they will go is not that a beautiful and consoling thought yes you may leave the room now but be carefulbe very careful iah he is gone and my friend hastings looks at me with eyes of reproach but it was all so simple it was clear from the first that out of several hundred probably applicants for no  montagu mansions only the robinsons were considered suitable why what was there that singled them out from the restat practically a glance their appearance possibly but it was not so unusual their name then but theres nothing unusual about the name of robinson i cried its quite a common name ah sapristi but exactly that was the point elsa hardt and her husband or brother or whatever he really is come from new york and take a flat in the name of mr and mrs robinson suddenly they learn that one of these secret societies the mafia or the camorra to which doubtless luigi valdarno belonged is on their track what do they do they hit on a scheme of transparent simplicity evidently they knew that their pursuers were not personally acquainted with either of them what then can be simpler they offer the flat at an absurdly low rental of the thousands of young couples in london looking for flats there cannot fail to be several robinsons it is only a matter of waiting if you will look at the name of robinson in the telephone directory you will realize that a fairhaired mrs robinson was pretty sure to come along sooner or later then what will happen the avenger arrives he knows the name he knows the address he strikes all is over vengeance is satisfied and miss elsa hardt has escaped by the skin of her teeth once more by the way hastings you must present me to the real mrs robinsonthat delightful and truthful creature what will they think when they find their flat has been broken into we must hurry back ah that sounds like japp and his friends arriving a mighty tattoo sounded on the knocker how did you know this address i asked as i followed poirot out into the hall oh of course you had the first mrs robinson followed when she left the other flat a la bonne heure hastings you use your grey cells at last now for a little surprise for japp softly unbolting the door he stuck the cats head round the edge and ejaculated a piercing miaow the scotland yard inspector who was standing outside with another man jumped in spite of himself oh its only monsieur poirot at one of his little jokes he exclaimed as poirots head followed that of the cat let us in moosior you have our friends safe and sound yes weve got the birds all right but they hadnt got the goods with them i see so you come to search well i am about to depart with hastings but i should like to give you a little lecture upon the history and habits of the domestic cat for the lords sake have you gone completely balmy the cat declaimed poirot was worshipped by the ancient egyptians it is still regarded as a symbol of good luck if a black cat crosses your path this cat crossed your path tonight japp to speak of the interior of any animal or any person is not i know considered polite in england but the interior of this cat is perfectly delicate i refer to the lining with a sudden grunt the second man seized the cat from poirots hand oh i forgot to introduce you said japp mr poirot this is mr burt of the united states secret service the americans trained fingers had felt what he was looking for he held out his hand and for a moment speech failed him then he rose to the occasion pleased to meet you said mr burt   iv   the mystery of hunters lodge after all murmured poirot it is possible that i shall not die this time coming from a convalescent influenza patient i hailed the remark as showing a beneficial optimism i myself had been the first sufferer from the disease poirot in his turn had gone down he was now sitting up in bed propped up with pillows his head muffled in a woollen shawl and was slowly sipping a particularly noxious tisane which i had prepared according to his directions his eye rested with pleasure upon a neatly graduated row of medicine bottles which adorned the mantelpiece yes yes my little friend continued once more shall i be myself again the great hercule poirot the terror of evildoers figure to yourself mon ami that i have a little paragraph to myself in society gossip but yes here it is go itcriminalsall out hercule poirotand believe me girls hes some herculesour own pet society detective cant get a grip on you cause why cause hes got la grippe himself i laughed good for you poirot you are becoming quite a public character and fortunately you havent missed anything of particular interest during this time that is true the few cases i have had to decline did not fill me with any regret our landlady stuck her head in at the door theres a gentleman downstairs says he must see monsieur poirot or you captain seeing as he was in a great todoand with all that quite the gentlemani brought up is card she handed me the bit of pasteboard mr roger havering i read poirot motioned with his head towards the bookcase and i obediently pulled forth whos who poirot took it from me and scanned the pages rapidly second son of fifth baron windsor married  zoe fourth daughter of william crabb hm i said i rather fancy thats the girl who used to act at the frivolityonly she called herself zoe carrisbrook i remember she married some young man about town just before the war would it interest you hastings to go down and hear what our visitors particular little trouble is make him all my excuses roger havering was a man of about forty well set up and of smart appearance his face however was haggard and he was evidently labouring under great agitation captain hastings you are monsieur poirots partner i understand it is imperative that he should come with me to derbyshire today im afraid thats impossible i replied poirot is ill in bedinfluenza his face fell dear me that is a great blow to me the matter on which you want to consult him is serious my god yes my uncle the best friend i have in the world was foully murdered last night here in london no in derbyshire i was in town and received a telegram from my wife this morning immediately upon its receipt i determined to come round and beg monsieur poirot to undertake the case if you will excuse me a minute i said struck by a sudden idea i rushed upstairs and in a few brief words acquainted poirot with the situation he took any further words out of my mouth i see i see you want to go yourself is it not so well why not you should know my methods by now all i ask is that you should report to me fully every day and follow implicitly any instructions i may wire you to this i willingly agreed                      an hour later i was sitting opposite mr havering in a firstclass carriage on the midland railway speeding rapidly away from london to begin with captain hastings you must understand that hunters lodge where we are going and where the tragedy took place is only a small shootingbox in the heart of the derbyshire moors our real home is near newmarket and we usually rent a flat in town for the season hunters lodge is looked after by a housekeeper who is quite capable of doing all we need when we run down for an occasional weekend of course during the shooting season we take down some of our own servants from newmarket my uncle mr harrington pace as you may know my mother was a miss pace of new york has for the last three years made his home with us he never got on well with my father or my elder brother and i suspect that my being somewhat of a prodigal son myself rather increased than diminished his affection towards me of course i am a poor man and my uncle was a rich onein other words he paid the piper but though exacting in many ways he was not really hard to get on with and we all three lived very harmoniously together two days ago my uncle rather wearied with some recent gaieties of ours in town suggested that we should run down to derbyshire for a day or two my wife telegraphed to mrs middleton the housekeeper and we went down that same afternoon yesterday evening i was forced to return to town but my wife and my uncle remained on this morning i received this telegram he handed it over to me come at once uncle harrington murdered last night bring good detective if you can but do comezoe then as yet you know no details no i suppose it will be in the evening papers without doubt the police are in charge it was about three oclock when we arrived at the little station of elmers dale from there a fivemile drive brought us to a small grey stone building in the midst of the rugged moors a lonely place i observed with a shiver havering nodded i shall try and get rid of it i could never live here again we unlatched the gate and were walking up the narrow path to the oak door when a familiar figure emerged and came to meet us japp i ejaculated the scotland yard inspector grinned at me in a friendly fashion before addressing my companion mr havering i think ive been sent down from london to take charge of this case and id like a word with you if i may sir my wife ive seen your good lady sirand the housekeeper i wont keep you a moment but im anxious to get back to the village now that ive seen all there is to see here i know nothing as yet as to what exactly said japp soothingly but there are just one or two little points id like your opinion about all the same captain hastings here he knows me and hell go on up to the house and tell them youre coming what have you done with the little man by the way captain hastings hes ill in bed with influenza is he now im sorry to hear that rather the case of the cart without the horse your being here without him isnt it and on his rather illtimed jest i went on to the house i rang the bell as japp had closed the door behind him after some moments it was opened to me by a middleaged woman in black mr havering will be here in a moment i explained he has been detained by the inspector i have come down with him from london to look into the case perhaps you can tell me briefly what occurred last night come inside sir she closed the door behind me and we stood in the dimlylighted hall it was after dinner last night sir that the man came he asked to see mr pace sir and seeing that he spoke the same way i thought it was an american gentleman friend of mr paces and i showed him into the gunroom and then went to tell mr pace he wouldnt give any name which of course was a bit odd now i come to think of it i told mr pace and he seemed puzzled like but he said to the mistress excuse me zoe while i just see what this fellow wants he went off to the gunroom and i went back to the kitchen but after a while i heard loud voices as if they were quarrelling and i came out into the hall at the same time the mistress she comes out too and just then there was a shot and then a dreadful silence we both ran to the gunroom door but it was locked and we had to go round to the window it was open and there inside was mr pace all shot and bleeding what became of the man he must have got away through the window sir before we got to it and then mrs havering sent me to fetch the police five miles to walk it was they came back with me and the constable he stayed all night and this morning the police gentleman from london arrived what was this man like who called to see mr pace the housekeeper reflected he had a black beard sir and was about middleaged and had on a light overcoat beyond the fact that he spoke like an american i didnt notice much about him i see now i wonder if i can see mrs havering shes upstairs sir shall i tell her if you please tell her that mr havering is outside with inspector japp and that the gentleman he has brought back with him from london is anxious to speak to her as soon as possible very good sir i was in a fever of impatience to get at all the facts japp had two or three hours start of me and his anxiety to be gone made me keen to be close at his heels mrs havering did not keep me waiting long in a few minutes i heard a light step descending the stairs and looked up to see a very handsome young woman coming towards me she wore a flamecoloured jumper that set off the slender boyishness of her figure on her dark head was a little hat of flamecoloured leather even the present tragedy could not dim the vitality of her personality i introduced myself and she nodded in quick comprehension of course i have often heard of you and your colleague monsieur poirot you have done some wonderful things together havent you it was very clever of my husband to get you so promptly now will you ask me questions that is the easiest way isnt it of getting to know all you want to about this dreadful affair thank you mrs havering now what time was it that this man arrived it must have been just before nine oclock we had finished dinner and were sitting over our coffee and cigarettes your husband had already left for london yes he went up by the  did he go by car to the station or did he walk our own car isnt down here one came out from the garage in elmers dale to fetch him in time for the train was mr pace quite his usual self absolutely most normal in every way now can you describe this visitor at all im afraid not i didnt see him mrs middleton showed him straight into the gunroom and then came to tell my uncle what did your uncle say he seemed rather annoyed but went off at once it was about five minutes later that i heard the sound of raised voices i ran out into the hall and almost collided with mrs middleton then we heard the shot the gunroom door was locked on the inside and we had to go right round the house to the window of course that took some time and the murderer had been able to get well away my poor uncleher voice falteredhad been shot through the head i saw at once that he was dead i sent mrs middleton for the police i was careful to touch nothing in the room but to leave it exactly as i found it i nodded approval now as to the weapon well i can make a guess at it captain hastings a pair of revolvers of my husbands were mounted upon the wall one of them is missing i pointed this out to the police and they took the other one away with them when they have extracted the bullet i suppose they will know for certain may i go to the gunroom certainly the police have finished with it but the body has been removed she accompanied me to the scene of the crime at that moment havering entered the hall and with a quick apology his wife ran to him i was left to undertake my investigations alone i may as well confess at once that they were rather disappointing in detective novels clues abound but here i could find nothing that struck me as out of the ordinary except a large bloodstain on the carpet where i judged the dead man had fallen i examined everything with painstaking care and took a couple of pictures of the room with my little camera which i had brought with me i also examined the ground outside the window but it appeared to have been so heavily trampled underfoot that i judged it was useless to waste time over it no i had seen all that hunters lodge had to show me i must go back to elmers dale and get into touch with japp accordingly i took leave of the haverings and was driven off in the car that had brought us up from the station i found japp at the matlock arms and he took me forthwith to see the body harrington pace was a small spare cleanshaven man typically american in appearance he had been shot through the back of the head and the revolver had been discharged at close quarters turned away for a moment remarked japp and the other fellow snatched up a revolver and shot him the one mrs havering handed over to us was fully loaded and i suppose the other one was also curious what darn fool things people do fancy keeping two loaded revolvers hanging up on your wall what do you think of the case i asked as we left the gruesome chamber behind us well id got my eye on havering to begin with oh yes noting my exclamation of astonishment havering has one or two shady incidents in his past when he was a boy at oxford there was some funny business about the signature on one of his fathers cheques all hushed up of course then hes pretty heavily in debt now and theyre the kind of debts he wouldnt like to go to his uncle about whereas you may be sure the uncles will would be in his favour yes id got my eye on him and thats why i wanted to speak to him before he saw his wife but their statements dovetail all right and ive been to the station and theres no doubt whatever that he left by the  that gets up to london about  he went straight to his club he says and if thats confirmed all rightwhy he couldnt have been shooting his uncle here at nine oclock in a black beard ah yes i was going to ask you what you thought about that beard japp winked i think it grew pretty fastgrew in the five miles from elmers dale to hunters lodge americans that ive met are mostly cleanshaven yes its amongst mr paces american associates that well have to look for the murderer i questioned the housekeeper first and then her mistress and their stories agree all right but im sorry mrs havering didnt get a look at the fellow shes a smart woman and she might have noticed something that would set us on the track i sat down and wrote a minute and lengthy account to poirot i was able to add various further items of information before i posted the letter the bullet had been extracted and was proved to have been fired from a revolver identical with the one held by the police furthermore mr haverings movements on the night in question had been checked and verified and it was proved beyond doubt that he had actually arrived in london by the train in question and thirdly a sensational development had occurred a city gentleman living at ealing on crossing haven green to get to the district railway station that morning had observed a brownpaper parcel stuck between the railings opening it he found that it contained a revolver he handed the parcel over to the local police station and before night it was proved to be the one we were in search of the fellow to that given us by mrs havering one bullet had been fired from it all this i added to my report a wire from poirot arrived whilst i was at breakfast the following morning of course black bearded man was not havering only you or japp would have such an idea wire me description of housekeeper and what clothes she wore this morning same of mrs havering do not waste time taking photographs of interiors they are underexposed and not in the least artistic it seemed to me that poirots style was unnecessarily facetious i also fancied he was a shade jealous of my position on the spot with full facilities for handling the case his request for a description of the clothes worn by the two women appeared to me to be simply ridiculous but i complied as well as i a mere man was able to at eleven a reply wire came from poirot advise japp arrest housekeeper before it is too late dumbfounded i took the wire to japp he swore softly under his breath hes the goods monsieur poirot if he says so theres something in it and i hardly noticed the woman i dont know that i can go so far as arresting her but ill have her watched well go up right away and take another look at her but it was too late mrs middleton that quiet middleaged woman who had appeared so normal and respectable had vanished into thin air her box had been left behind it contained only ordinary wearing apparel there was no clue in it to her identity or as to her whereabouts from mrs havering we elicited all the facts we could i engaged her about three weeks ago when mrs emery our former housekeeper left she came to me from mrs selbournes agency in mount streeta very wellknown place i get all my servants from there they sent several women to see me but this mrs middleton seemed much the nicest and had splendid references i engaged her on the spot and notified the agency of the fact i cant believe that there was anything wrong with her she was such a nice quiet woman the thing was certainly a mystery whilst it was clear that the woman herself could not have committed the crime since at the moment the shot was fired mrs havering was with her in the hall nevertheless she must have some connection with the murder or why should she suddenly take to her heels and bolt i wired the latest development to poirot and suggested returning to london and making inquiries at selbournes agency poirots reply was prompt useless to inquire at agency they will never have heard of her find out what vehicle took her up to hunters lodge when she first arrived there though mystified i was obedient the means of transport in elmers dale were limited the local garage had two battered ford cars and there were two station flies none of these had been requisitioned on the date in question questioned mrs havering explained that she had given the woman the money for her fare down to derbyshire and sufficient to hire a car or fly to take her up to hunters lodge there was usually one of the fords at the station on the chance of its being required taking into consideration the further fact that nobody at the station had noticed the arrival of a stranger blackbearded or otherwise on the fatal evening everything seemed to point to the conclusion that the murderer had come to the spot in a car which had been waiting near at hand to aid his escape and that the same car had brought the mysterious housekeeper to her new post i may mention that inquiries at the agency in london bore out poirots prognostication no such woman as mrs middleton had ever been on their books they had received the hon mrs haverings application for a housekeeper and had sent her various applicants for the post when she sent them the engagement fee she omitted to mention which woman she had selected somewhat crestfallen i returned to london i found poirot established in an armchair by the fire in a garish silk dressinggown he greeted me with much affection mon ami hastings but how glad i am to see you veritably i have for you a great affection and you have enjoyed yourself you have run to and fro with the good japp you have interrogated and investigated to your hearts content poirot i cried the things a dark mystery it will never be solved it is true that we are not likely to cover ourselves with glory over it no indeed its a hard nut to crack oh as far as that goes i am very good at cracking the nuts a veritable squirrel it is not that which embarrasses me i know well enough who killed mr harrington pace you know how did you find out your illuminating answers to my wires supplied me with the truth see here hastings let us examine the facts methodically and in order mr harrington pace is a man with a considerable fortune which at his death will doubtless pass to his nephew point no  his nephew is known to be desperately hard up point no  his nephew is also known to beshall we say a man of rather loose moral fibre point no  but roger havering is proved to have journeyed straight up to london prcismentand therefore as mr havering left elmers dale at  and since mr pace cannot have been killed before he left or the doctor would have spotted the time of the crime as being given wrongly when he examined the body we conclude quite rightly that mr havering did not shoot his uncle but there is a mrs havering hastings impossible the housekeeper was with her when the shot was fired ah yes the housekeeper but she has disappeared she will be found i think not there is something peculiarly elusive about that housekeeper dont you think so hastings it struck me at once she played her part i suppose and then got out in the nick of time and what was her part well presumably to admit her confederate the blackbearded man oh no that was not her part her part was what you have just mentioned to provide an alibi for mrs havering at the moment the shot was fired and no one will ever find her mon ami because she does not exist theres no sech person as your so great shakespeare says it was dickens i murmured unable to suppress a smile but what do you mean poirot i mean that zoe havering was an actress before her marriage that you and japp only saw the housekeeper in a dark hall a dim middleaged figure in black with a faint subdued voice and finally that neither you nor japp nor the local police whom the housekeeper fetched ever saw mrs middleton and her mistress at one and the same time it was childs play for that clever and daring woman on the pretext of summoning her mistress she runs upstairs slips on a bright jumper and a hat with black curls attached which she jams down over the grey transformation a few deft touches and the makeup is removed a slight dusting of rouge and the brilliant zoe havering comes down with her clear ringing voice nobody looks particularly at the housekeeper why should they there is nothing to connect her with the crime she too has an alibi but the revolver that was found at ealing mrs havering could not have placed it there no that was roger haverings jobbut it was a mistake on their part it put me on the right track a man who has committed a murder with a revolver which he found on the spot would fling it away at once he would not carry it up to london with him no the motive was clear the criminals wished to focus the interest of the police on a spot far removed from derbyshire they were anxious to get the police away as soon as possible from the vicinity of hunters lodge of course the revolver found at ealing was not the one with which mr pace was shot roger havering discharged one shot from it brought it up to london went straight to his club to establish his alibi then went quickly out to ealing by the district a matter of about twenty minutes only placed the parcel where it was found and so back to town that charming creature his wife quietly shoots mr pace after dinneryou remember he was shot from behind another significant point thatreloads the revolver and puts it back in its place and then starts off with her desperate little comedy its incredible i murmured fascinated and yet and yet it is true bien sur my friend it is true but to bring that precious pair to justice that is another matter well japp must do what he cani have written him fullybut i very much fear hastings that we shall be obliged to leave them to fate or le bon dieu whichever you prefer the wicked flourish like a green bay tree i reminded him but at a price hastings always at a price croyezmoi poirots forebodings were confirmed japp though convinced of the truth of his theory was unable to get together the necessary evidence to ensure a conviction mr paces huge fortune passed into the hands of his murderers nevertheless nemesis did overtake them and when i read in the paper that the hon roger and mrs havering were amongst those killed in the crashing of the air mail to paris i knew that justice was satisfied   v   the million dollar bond robbery what a number of bond robberies there have been lately i observed one morning laying aside the newspaper poirot let us forsake the science of detection and take to crime instead you are on thehow do you say itgetrichquick tack eh mon ami well look at this last coup the million dollars worth of liberty bonds which the london and scottish bank were sending to new york and which disappeared in such a remarkable manner on board the olympia if it were not for the mal de mer and the difficulty of practising the so excellent method of laverguier for a longer time than the few hours of crossing the channel i should delight to voyage myself on one of these big liners murmured poirot dreamily yes indeed i said enthusiastically some of them must be perfect palaces the swimmingbaths the lounges the restaurant the palm courtsreally it must be hard to believe that one is on the sea me i always know when i am on the sea said poirot sadly and all those bagatelles that you enumerate they say nothing to me but my friend consider for a moment the geniuses that travel as it were incognito on board these floating palaces as you so justly call them one would meet the lite the haute noblesse of the criminal world i laughed so thats the way your enthusiasm runs you would have liked to cross swords with the man who sneaked the liberty bonds the landlady interrupted us a young lady as wants to see you mr poirot heres her card the card bore the inscription miss esme farquhar and poirot after diving under the table to retrieve a stray crumb and putting it carefully in the wastepaperbasket nodded to the landlady to admit her in another minute one of the most charming girls i have ever seen was ushered into the room she was perhaps about fiveandtwenty with big brown eyes and a perfect figure she was welldressed and perfectly composed in manner sit down i beg of you mademoiselle this is my friend captain hastings who aids me in my little problems i am afraid it is a big problem i have brought you today monsieur poirot said the girl giving me a pleasant bow as she seated herself i dare say you have read about it in the papers i am referring to the theft of liberty bonds on the olympia some astonishment must have shown itself in poirots face for she continued quickly you are doubtless asking yourself what i have to do with a grave institution like the london and scottish bank in one sense nothing in another sense everything you see monsieur poirot i am engaged to mr philip ridgeway aha and mr philip ridgeway was in charge of the bonds when they were stolen of course no actual blame can attach to him it was not his fault in any way nevertheless he is half distraught over the matter and his uncle i know insists that he must carelessly have mentioned having them in his possession it is a terrible setback in his career who is his uncle mr vavasour joint general manager of the london and scottish bank suppose miss farquhar that you recount to me the whole story very well as you know the bank wished to extend their credits in america and for this purpose decided to send over a million dollars in liberty bonds mr vavasour selected his nephew who had occupied a position of trust in the bank for many years and who was conversant with all the details of the banks dealings in new york to make the trip the olympia sailed from liverpool on the rd and the bonds were handed over to philip on the morning of that day by mr vavasour and mr shaw the two joint general managers of the london and scottish bank they were counted enclosed in a package and sealed in his presence and he then locked the package at once in his portmanteau a portmanteau with an ordinary lock no mr shaw insisted on a special lock being fitted to it by hubbss philip as i say placed the package at the bottom of the trunk it was stolen just a few hours before reaching new york a rigorous search of the whole ship was made but without result the bonds seemed literally to have vanished into thin air poirot made a grimace but they did not vanish absolutely since i gather that they were sold in small parcels within half an hour of the docking of the olympia well undoubtedly the next thing is for me to see mr ridgeway i was about to suggest that you should lunch with me at the cheshire cheese philip will be there he is meeting me but does not yet know that i have been consulting you on his behalf we agreed to this suggestion readily enough and drove there in a taxi mr philip ridgeway was there before us and looked somewhat surprised to see his fiance arriving with two complete strangers he was a nicelooking young fellow tall and spruce with a touch of greying hair at the temples though he could not have been much over thirty miss farquhar went up to him and laid her hand on his arm you must forgive my acting without consulting you philip she said let me introduce you to monsieur hercule poirot of whom you must often have heard and his friend captain hastings ridgeway looked very astonished of course i have heard of you monsieur poirot he said as he shook hands but i had no idea that esme was thinking of consulting you about myour trouble i was afraid you would not let me do it philip said miss farquhar meekly so you took care to be on the safe side he observed with a smile i hope monsieur poirot will be able to throw some light on this extraordinary puzzle for i confess frankly that i am nearly out of my mind with worry and anxiety about it indeed his face looked drawn and haggard and showed only too clearly the strain under which he was labouring well well said poirot let us lunch and over lunch we will put our heads together and see what can be done i want to hear mr ridgeways story from his own lips whilst we discussed the excellent steak and kidney pudding of the establishment philip ridgeway narrated the circumstances leading to the disappearance of the bonds his story agreed with that of miss farquhar in every particular when he had finished poirot took up the thread with a question what exactly led you to discover that the bonds had been stolen mr ridgeway he laughed rather bitterly the thing stared me in the face monsieur poirot i couldnt have missed it my cabin trunk was half out from under the bunk and all scratched and cut about where theyd tried to force the lock but i understood that it had been opened with a key thats so they tried to force it but couldnt and in the end they must have got it unlocked somehow or other curious said poirot his eyes beginning to flicker with the green light i knew so well very curious they waste much much time trying to prise it open and thensapristi they find that they have the key all the timefor each of hubbss locks are unique thats just why they couldnt have had the key it never left me day or night you are sure of that i can swear to it and besides if they had had the key or a duplicate why should they waste time trying to force an obviously unforceable lock ah there is exactly the question we are asking ourselves i venture to prophesy that the solution if we ever find it will hinge on that curious fact i beg of you not to assault me if i ask you one more question are you perfectly certain you did not leave the trunk unlocked philip ridgeway merely looked at him and poirot gesticulated apologetically ah but these things can happen i assure you very well the bonds were stolen from the trunk what did the thief do with them how did he manage to get ashore with them ah cried ridgeway thats just it how word was passed to the customs authorities and every soul that left the ship was gone over with a toothcomb and the bonds i gather made a bulky package certainly they did they could hardly have been hidden on boardand anyway we know they werent because they were offered for sale within half an hour of the olympias arrival long before i got the cables going and the numbers sent out one broker swears he bought some of them even before the olympia got in but you cant send bonds by wireless not by wireless but did any tug come alongside only the official ones and that was after the alarm was given when every one was on the lookout i was watching out myself for their being passed over to some one that way my god monsieur poirot this thing will drive me mad people are beginning to say i stole them myself but you also were searched on landing werent you asked poirot gently yes the young man stared at him in a puzzled manner you do not catch my meaning i see said poirot smiling enigmatically now i should like to make a few inquiries at the bank ridgeway produced a card and scribbled a few words on it send this in and my uncle will see you at once poirot thanked him bade farewell to miss farquhar and together we started out for threadneedle street and the head office of the london and scottish bank on production of ridgeways card we were led through the labyrinth of counters and desks skirting payingin clerks and payingout clerks and up to a small office on the first floor where the joint general managers received us they were two grave gentlemen who had grown grey in the service of the bank mr vavasour had a short white beard mr shaw was clean shaven i understand you are strictly a private inquiry agent said mr vavasour quite so quite so we have of course placed ourselves in the hands of scotland yard inspector mcneil has charge of the case a very able officer i believe i am sure of it said poirot politely you will permit a few questions on your nephews behalf about this lock who ordered it from hubbss i ordered it myself said mr shaw i would not trust to any clerk in the matter as to the keys mr ridgeway had one and the other two are held by my colleague and myself and no clerk has had access to them mr shaw turned inquiringly to mr vavasour i think i am correct in saying that they have remained in the safe where we placed them on the rd said mr vavasour my colleague was unfortunately taken ill a fortnight agoin fact on the very day that philip left us he has only just recovered severe bronchitis is no joke to a man of my age said mr shaw ruefully but i am afraid mr vavasour has suffered from the hard work entailed by my absence especially with this unexpected worry coming on top of everything poirot asked a few more questions i judged that he was endeavouring to gauge the exact amount of intimacy between uncle and nephew mr vavasours answers were brief and punctilious his nephew was a trusted official of the bank and had no debts or money difficulties that he knew of he had been entrusted with similar missions in the past finally we were politely bowed out i am disappointed said poirot as we emerged into the street you hoped to discover more they are such stodgy old men it is not their stodginess which disappoints me mon ami i do not expect to find in a bank manager a keen financier with an eagle glance as your favourite works of fiction put it no i am disappointed in the caseit is too easy easy yes do you not find it almost childishly simple you know who stole the bonds i do but thenwe mustwhy do not confuse and fluster yourself hastings we are not going to do anything at present but why what are you waiting for for the olympia she is due on her return trip from new york on tuesday but if you know who stole the bonds why wait he may escape to a south sea island where there is no extradition no mon ami he would find life very uncongenial there as to why i waiteh bien to the intelligence of hercule poirot the case is perfectly clear but for the benefit of others not so greatly gifted by the good godthe inspector mcneil for instanceit would be as well to make a few inquiries to establish the facts one must have consideration for those less gifted than oneself good lord poirot do you know id give a considerable sum of money to see you make a thorough ass of yourselfjust for once youre so confoundedly conceited do not enrage yourself hastings in verity i observe that there are times when you almost detest me alas i suffer the penalties of greatness the little man puffed out his chest and sighed so comically that i was forced to laugh tuesday saw us speeding to liverpool in a firstclass carriage of the l  nwr poirot had obstinately refused to enlighten me as to his suspicionsor certainties he contented himself with expressing surprise that i too was not equally au fait with the situation i disdained to argue and entrenched my curiosity behind a rampart of pretended indifference once arrived at the quay alongside which lay the big transatlantic liner poirot became brisk and alert our proceedings consisted in interviewing four successive stewards and inquiring after a friend of poirots who had crossed to new york on the rd an elderly gentleman wearing glasses a great invalid hardly moved out of his cabin the description appeared to tally with one mr ventnor who had occupied the cabin c  which was next to that of philip ridgeway although unable to see how poirot had deduced mr ventnors existence and personal appearance i was keenly excited tell me i cried was this gentleman one of the first to land when you got to new york the steward shook his head no indeed sir he was one of the last off the boat i retired crestfallen and observed poirot grinning at me he thanked the steward a note changed hands and we took our departure its all very well i remarked heatedly but that last answer must have damped your precious theory grin as you please as usual you see nothing hastings that last answer is on the contrary the copingstone of my theory i flung up my hands in despair i give it up                      when we were in the train speeding towards london poirot wrote busily for a few minutes sealing up the result in an envelope this is for the good inspector mcneil we will leave it at scotland yard in passing and then to the rendezvous restaurant where i have asked miss esme farquhar to do us the honour of dining with us what about ridgeway what about him asked poirot with a twinkle why you surely dont thinkyou cant the habit of incoherence is growing upon you hastings as a matter of fact i did think if ridgeway had been the thiefwhich was perfectly possiblethe case would have been charming a piece of neat methodical work but not so charming for miss farquhar possibly you are right therefore all is for the best now hastings let us review the case i can see that you are dying to do so the sealed package is removed from the trunk and vanishes as miss farquhar puts it into thin air we will dismiss the thin air theory which is not practicable at the present stage of science and consider what is likely to have become of it every one asserts the incredibility of its being smuggled ashore yes but we know you may know hastings i do not i take the view that since it seemed incredible it was incredible two possibilities remain it was hidden on boardalso rather difficultor it was thrown overboard with a cork on it do you mean without a cork i stared but if the bonds were thrown overboard they couldnt have been sold in new york i admire your logical mind hastings the bonds were sold in new york therefore they were not thrown overboard you see where that leads us where we were when we started jamais de la vie if the package was thrown overboard and the bonds were sold in new york the package could not have contained the bonds is there any evidence that the package did contain the bonds remember mr ridgeway never opened it from the time it was placed in his hands in london yes but then poirot waved an impatient hand permit me to continue the last moment that the bonds are seen as bonds is in the office of the london and scottish bank on the morning of the rd they reappear in new york half an hour after the olympia gets in and according to one man whom nobody listens to actually before she gets in supposing then that they have never been on the olympia at all is there any other way they could get to new york yes the gigantic leaves southampton on the same day as the olympia and she holds the record for the atlantic mailed by the gigantic the bonds would be in new york the day before the olympia arrived all is clear the case begins to explain itself the sealed packet is only a dummy and the moment of its substitution must be in the office in the bank it would be an easy matter for any of the three men present to have prepared a duplicate package which could be substituted for the genuine one trs bien the bonds are mailed to a confederate in new york with instructions to sell as soon as the olympia is in but some one must travel on the olympia to engineer the supposed moment of the robbery but why because if ridgeway merely opens the packet and finds it a dummy suspicion flies at once to london no the man on board in the cabin next door does his work pretends to force the lock in an obvious manner so as to draw immediate attention to the theft really unlocks the trunk with a duplicate key throws the package overboard and waits until the last to leave the boat naturally he wears glasses to conceal his eyes and is an invalid since he does not want to run the risk of meeting ridgeway he steps ashore in new york and returns by the first boat available but whowhich was he the man who had a duplicate key the man who ordered the lock the man who has not been severely ill with bronchitis at his home in the countryenfin that stodgy old man mr shaw there are criminals in high places sometimes my friend ah here we are mademoiselle i have succeeded you permit and beaming poirot kissed the astonished girl lightly on either cheek   vi   the adventure of the egyptian tomb i have always considered that one of the most thrilling and dramatic of the many adventures i have shared with poirot was that of our investigation into the strange series of deaths which followed upon the discovery and opening of the tomb of king menherra hard upon the discovery of the tomb of tutankhamen by lord carnarvon sir john willard and mr bleibner of new york pursuing their excavations not far from cairo in the vicinity of the pyramids of gizeh came unexpectedly on a series of funeral chambers the greatest interest was aroused by their discovery the tomb appeared to be that of king menherra one of those shadowy kings of the eighth dynasty when the old kingdom was falling to decay little was known about this period and the discoveries were fully reported in the newspapers an event soon occurred which took a profound hold on the public mind sir john willard died quite suddenly of heart failure the more sensational newspapers immediately took the opportunity of reviving all the old superstitious stories connected with the ill luck of certain egyptian treasures the unlucky mummy at the british museum that hoary old chestnut was dragged out with fresh zest was quietly denied by the museum but nevertheless enjoyed all its usual vogue a fortnight later mr bleibner died of acute blood poisoning and a few days afterwards a nephew of his shot himself in new york the curse of menherra was the talk of the day and the magic power of dead and gone egypt was exalted to a fetish point it was then that poirot received a brief note from lady willard widow of the dead archaeologist asking him to go and see her at her house in kensington square i accompanied him lady willard was a tall thin woman dressed in deep mourning her haggard face bore eloquent testimony to her recent grief it is kind of you to have come so promptly monsieur poirot i am at your service lady willard you wished to consult me you are i am aware a detective but it is not only as a detective that i wish to consult you you are a man of original views i know you have imagination experience of the world tell me monsieur poirot what are your views on the supernatural poirot hesitated for a moment before he replied he seemed to be considering finally he said let us not misunderstand each other lady willard it is not a general question that you are asking me there it has a personal application has it not you are referring obliquely to the death of your late husband that is so she admitted you want me to investigate the circumstances of his death i want you to ascertain for me exactly how much is newspaper chatter and how much may be said to be founded on fact three deaths monsieur poiroteach one explicable taken by itself but taken together surely an almost unbelievable coincidence and all within a month of the opening of the tomb it may be mere superstition it may be some potent curse from the past that operates in ways undreamed of by modern science the fact remainsthree deaths and i am afraid monsieur poirot horribly afraid it may not yet be the end for whom do you fear for my son when the news of my husbands death came i was ill my son who has just come down from oxford went out there he brought thethe body home but now he has gone out again in spite of my prayers and entreaties he is so fascinated by the work that he intends to take his fathers place and carry on the system of excavations you may think me a foolish credulous woman but monsieur poirot i am afraid supposing that the spirit of the dead king is not yet appeased perhaps to you i seem to be talking nonsense no indeed lady willard said poirot quickly i too believe in the force of superstition one of the greatest forces the world has ever known i looked at him in surprise i should never have credited poirot with being superstitious but the little man was obviously in earnest what you really demand is that i shall protect your son i will do my utmost to keep him from harm yes in the ordinary way but against an occult influence in volumes of the middle ages lady willard you will find many ways of counteracting black magic perhaps they knew more than we moderns with all our boasted science now let us come to facts that i may have guidance your husband had always been a devoted egyptologist hadnt he yes from his youth upwards he was one of the greatest living authorities upon the subject but mr bleibner i understand was more or less of an amateur oh quite he was a very wealthy man who dabbled freely in any subject that happened to take his fancy my husband managed to interest him in egyptology and it was his money that was so useful in financing the expedition and the nephew what do you know of his tastes was he with the party at all i do not think so in fact i never knew of his existence till i read of his death in the paper i do not think he and mr bleibner can have been at all intimate he never spoke of having any relations who are the other members of the party well there is dr tosswill a minor official connected with the british museum mr schneider of the metropolitan museum in new york a young american secretary dr ames who accompanies the expedition in his professional capacity and hassan my husbands devoted native servant do you remember the name of the american secretary harper i think but i cannot be sure he had not been with mr bleibner very long i know he was a very pleasant young fellow thank you lady willard if there is anything else for the moment nothing leave it now in my hands and be assured that i will do all that is humanly possible to protect your son they were not exactly reassuring words and i observed lady willard wince as he uttered them yet at the same time the fact that he had not poohpoohed her fears seemed in itself to be a relief to her for my part i had never before suspected that poirot had so deep a vein of superstition in his nature i tackled him on the subject as we went homewards his manner was grave and earnest but yes hastings i believe in these things you must not underrate the force of superstition what are we going to do about it toujours pratique the good hastings eh bien to begin with we are going to cable to new york for fuller details of young mr bleibners death he duly sent off his cable the reply was full and precise young rupert bleibner had been in low water for several years he had been a beachcomber and a remittance man in several south sea islands but had returned to new york two years ago where he had rapidly sunk lower and lower the most significant thing to my mind was that he had recently managed to borrow enough money to take him to egypt ive a good friend there i can borrow from he had declared here however his plans had gone awry he had returned to new york cursing his skinflint of an uncle who cared more for the bones of dead and gone kings than his own flesh and blood it was during his sojourn in egypt that the death of sir john willard occurred rupert had plunged once more into his life of dissipation in new york and then without warning he had committed suicide leaving behind him a letter which contained some curious phrases it seemed written in a sudden fit of remorse he referred to himself as a leper and an outcast and the letter ended by declaring that such as he were better dead a shadowy theory leapt into my brain i had never really believed in the vengeance of a long dead egyptian king i saw here a more modern crime supposing this young man had decided to do away with his unclepreferably by poison by mistake sir john willard receives the fatal dose the young man returns to new york haunted by his crime the news of his uncles death reaches him he realizes how unnecessary his crime has been and stricken with remorse takes his own life i outlined my solution to poirot he was interested it is ingenious what you have thought of theredecidedly it is ingenious it may even be true but you leave out of count the fatal influence of the tomb i shrugged my shoulders you still think that has something to do with it so much so mon ami that we start for egypt tomorrow what i cried astonished i have said it an expression of conscious heroism spread over poirots face then he groaned but oh he lamented the sea the hateful sea                      it was a week later beneath our feet was the golden sand of the desert the hot sun poured down overhead poirot the picture of misery wilted by my side the little man was not a good traveller our four days voyage from marseilles had been one long agony to him he had landed at alexandria the wraith of his former self even his usual neatness had deserted him we had arrived in cairo and had driven out at once to the mena house hotel right in the shadow of the pyramids the charm of egypt had laid hold of me not so poirot dressed precisely the same as in london he carried a small clothesbrush in his pocket and waged an unceasing war on the dust which accumulated on his dark apparel and my boots he wailed regard them hastings my boots of the neat patent leather usually so smart and shining see the sand is inside them which is painful and outside them which outrages the eyesight also the heat it causes my moustaches to become limpbut limp look at the sphinx i urged even i can feel the mystery and the charm it exhales poirot looked at it discontentedly it has not the air happy he declared how could it halfburied in sand in that untidy fashion ah this cursed sand come now theres a lot of sand in belgium i reminded him mindful of a holiday spent at knockesurmer in the midst of les dunes impeccables as the guidebook had phrased it not in brussels declared poirot he gazed at the pyramids thoughtfully it is true that they at least are of a shape solid and geometrical but their surface is of an unevenness most unpleasing and the palmtrees i like them not not even do they plant them in rows i cut short his lamentations by suggesting that we should start for the camp we were to ride there on camels and the beasts were patiently kneeling waiting for us to mount in charge of several picturesque boys headed by a voluble dragoman i pass over the spectacle of poirot on a camel he started by groans and lamentations and ended by shrieks gesticulations and invocations to the virgin mary and every saint in the calendar in the end he descended ignominiously and finished the journey on a diminutive donkey i must admit that a trotting camel is no joke for the amateur i was stiff for several days at last we neared the scene of the excavations a sunburnt man with a grey beard in white clothes and wearing a helmet came to meet us monsieur poirot and captain hastings we received your cable im sorry that there was no one to meet you in cairo an unforeseen event occurred which completely disorganized our plans poirot paled his hand which had stolen to his clothesbrush stayed its course not another death he breathed yes sir guy willard i cried no captain hastings my american colleague mr schneider and the cause demanded poirot tetanus i blanched all around me i seemed to feel an atmosphere of evil subtle and menacing a horrible thought flashed across me supposing i were the next mon dieu said poirot in a very low voice i do not understand this it is horrible tell me monsieur there is no doubt that it was tetanus i believe not but dr ames will tell you more than i can do ah of course you are not the doctor my name is tosswill this then was the british expert described by lady willard as being a minor official at the british museum there was something at once grave and steadfast about him that took my fancy if you will come with me continued dr tosswill i will take you to sir guy willard he was most anxious to be informed as soon as you should arrive we were taken across the camp to a large tent dr tosswill lifted up the flap and we entered three men were sitting inside monsieur poirot and captain hastings have arrived sir guy said tosswill the youngest of the three men jumped up and came forward to greet us there was a certain impulsiveness in his manner which reminded me of his mother he was not nearly so sunburnt as the others and that fact coupled with a certain haggardness round the eyes made him look older than his twentytwo years he was clearly endeavouring to bear up under a severe mental strain he introduced his two companions dr ames a capable looking man of thirty odd with a touch of greying hair at the temples and mr harper the secretary a pleasant lean young man wearing the national insignia of hornrimmed spectacles after a few minutes desultory conversation the latter went out and dr tosswill followed him we were left alone with sir guy and dr ames please ask any questions you want to ask monsieur poirot said willard we are utterly dumbfounded at this strange series of disasters but it isntit cant be anything but coincidence there was a nervousness about his manner which rather belied the words i saw that poirot was studying him keenly your heart is really in this work sir guy rather no matter what happens or what comes of it the work is going on make up your mind to that poirot wheeled round on the other what have you to say to that monsieur le docteur well drawled the doctor im not for quitting myself poirot made one of those expressive grimaces of his then videmment we must find out just how we stand when did mr schneiders death take place three days ago you are sure it was tetanus dead sure it couldnt have been a case of strychnine poisoning for instance no monsieur poirot i see what youre getting at but it was a clear case of tetanus did you not inject antiserum certainly we did said the doctor dryly every conceivable thing that could be done was tried had you the antiserum with you no we procured it from cairo have there been any other cases of tetanus in the camp no not one are you certain that the death of mr bleibner was not due to tetanus absolutely plumb certain he had a scratch upon his thumb which became poisoned and septicmia set in it sounds pretty much the same to a layman i dare say but the two things are entirely different then we have four deathsall totally dissimilar one heart failure one blood poisoning one suicide and one tetanus exactly monsieur poirot are you certain that there is nothing which might link the four together i dont quite understand you i will put it plainly was any act committed by those four men which might seem to denote disrespect to the spirit of menherra the doctor gazed at poirot in astonishment youre talking through your hat monsieur poirot surely youve not been guyed into believing all that fool talk absolute nonsense muttered willard angrily poirot remained placidly immovable blinking a little out of his green cats eyes so you do not believe it monsieur le docteur no sir i do not declared the doctor emphatically i am a scientific man and i believe only what science teaches was there no science then in ancient egypt asked poirot softly he did not wait for a reply and indeed dr ames seemed rather at a loss for the moment no no do not answer me but tell me this what do the native workmen think i guess said dr ames that where white folk lose their heads natives arent going to be far behind ill admit that theyre getting what you might call scaredbut theyve no cause to be i wonder said poirot noncommittally sir guy leant forward surely he cried incredulously you cannot believe inoh but the things absurd you can know nothing of ancient egypt if you think that for answer poirot produced a little book from his pocketan ancient tattered volume as he held it out i saw its title the magic of the egyptians and chaldeans then wheeling round he strode out of the tent the doctor stared at me what is his little idea the phrase so familiar on poirots lips made me smile as it came from another i dont know exactly i confessed hes got some plan of exorcizing the evil spirits i believe i went in search of poirot and found him talking to the leanfaced young man who had been the late mr bleibners secretary no mr harper was saying ive only been six months with the expedition yes i knew mr bleibners affairs pretty well can you recount to me anything concerning his nephew he turned up here one day not a badlooking fellow id never met him before but some of the others hadames i think and schneider the old man wasnt at all pleased to see him they were at it in no time hammer and tongs not a cent the old man shouted not one cent now or when im dead i intend to leave my money to the furtherance of my lifes work ive been talking it over with mr schneider today and a bit more of the same young bleibner lit out for cairo right away was he in perfectly good health at the time the old man no the young one i believe he did mention there was something wrong with him but it couldnt have been anything serious or i should have remembered one thing more has mr bleibner left a will so far as we know he has not are you remaining with the expedition mr harper no sir i am not im for new york as soon as i can square up things here you may laugh if you like but im not going to be this blasted old menherras next victim hell get me if i stop here the young man wiped the perspiration from his brow poirot turned away over his shoulder he said with a peculiar smile remember he got one of his victims in new york oh hell said mr harper forcibly that young man is nervous said poirot thoughtfully he is on the edge but absolutely on the edge i glanced at poirot curiously but his enigmatical smile told me nothing in company with sir guy willard and dr tosswill we were taken round the excavations the principal finds had been removed to cairo but some of the tomb furniture was extremely interesting the enthusiasm of the young baronet was obvious but i fancied that i detected a shade of nervousness in his manner as though he could not quite escape from the feeling of menace in the air as we entered the tent which had been assigned to us for a wash before joining the evening meal a tall dark figure in white robes stood aside to let us pass with a graceful gesture and a murmured greeting in arabic poirot stopped you are hassan the late sir john willards servant i served my lord sir john now i serve his son he took a step nearer to us and lowered his voice you are a wise one they say learned in dealing with evil spirits let the young master depart from here there is evil in the air around us and with an abrupt gesture not waiting for a reply he strode away evil in the air muttered poirot yes i feel it our meal was hardly a cheerful one the floor was left to dr tosswill who discoursed at length upon egyptian antiquities just as we were preparing to retire to rest sir guy caught poirot by the arm and pointed a shadowy figure was moving amidst the tents it was no human one i recognized distinctly the dogheaded figure i had seen carved on the walls of the tomb my blood literally froze at the sight mon dieu murmured poirot crossing himself vigorously anubis the jackalheaded the god of departing souls some one is hoaxing us cried dr tosswill rising indignantly to his feet it went into your tent harper muttered sir guy his face dreadfully pale no said poirot shaking his head into that of the dr ames the doctor stared at him incredulously then repeating dr tosswills words he cried some one is hoaxing us come well soon catch the fellow he dashed energetically in pursuit of the shadowy apparition i followed him but search as we would we could find no trace of any living soul having passed that way we returned somewhat disturbed in mind to find poirot taking energetic measures in his own way to ensure his personal safety he was busily surrounding our tent with various diagrams and inscriptions which he was drawing in the sand i recognized the fivepointed star or pentagon many times repeated as was his wont poirot was at the same time delivering an impromptu lecture on witchcraft and magic in general white magic as opposed to black with various references to the ka and the book of the dead thrown in it appeared to excite the liveliest contempt in dr tosswill who drew me aside literally snorting with rage balderdash sir he exclaimed angrily pure balderdash the mans an impostor he doesnt know the difference between the superstitions of the middle ages and the beliefs of ancient egypt never have i heard such a hotchpotch of ignorance and credulity i calmed the excited expert and joined poirot in the tent my little friend was beaming cheerfully we can now sleep in peace he declared happily and i can do with some sleep my head it aches abominably ah for a good tisane as though in answer to prayer the flap of the tent was lifted and hassan appeared bearing a steaming cup which he offered to poirot it proved to be camomile tea a beverage of which he is inordinately fond having thanked hassan and refused his offer of another cup for myself we were left alone once more i stood at the door of the tent some time after undressing looking out over the desert a wonderful place i said aloud and a wonderful work i can feel the fascination this desert life this probing into the heart of a vanished civilization surely poirot you too must feel the charm i got no answer and i turned a little annoyed my annoyance was quickly changed to concern poirot was lying back across the rude couch his face horribly convulsed beside him was the empty cup i rushed to his side then dashed out and across the camp to dr amess tent dr ames i cried come at once whats the matter said the doctor appearing in pyjamas my friend hes ill dying the camomile tea dont let hassan leave the camp like a flash the doctor ran to our tent poirot was lying as i left him extraordinary cried ames looks like a seizureorwhat did you say about something he drank he picked up the empty cup only i did not drink it said a placid voice we turned in amazement poirot was sitting up on the bed he was smiling no he said gently i did not drink it while my good friend hastings was apostrophizing the night i took the opportunity of pouring it not down my throat but into a little bottle that little bottle will go to the analytical chemist noas the doctor made a sudden movementas a sensible man you will understand that violence will be of no avail during hastings brief absence to fetch you i have had time to put the bottle in safe keeping ah quick hastings hold him i misunderstood poirots anxiety eager to save my friend i flung myself in front of him but the doctors swift movement had another meaning his hand went to his mouth a smell of bitter almonds filled the air and he swayed forward and fell another victim said poirot gravely but the last perhaps it is the best way he has three deaths on his head dr ames i cried stupefied but i thought you believed in some occult influence you misunderstood me hastings what i meant was that i believe in the terrific force of superstition once get it firmly established that a series of deaths are supernatural and you might almost stab a man in broad daylight and it would still be put down to the curse so strongly is the instinct of the supernatural implanted in the human race i suspected from the first that a man was taking advantage of that instinct the idea came to him i imagine with the death of sir john willard a fury of superstition arose at once as far as i could see nobody could derive any particular profit from sir johns death mr bleibner was a different case he was a man of great wealth the information i received from new york contained several suggestive points to begin with young bleibner was reported to have said he had a good friend in egypt from whom he could borrow it was tacitly understood that he meant his uncle but it seemed to me that in that case he would have said so outright the words suggest some boon companion of his own another thing he scraped up enough money to take him to egypt his uncle refused outright to advance him a penny yet he was able to pay the return passage to new york some one must have lent him the money all that was very thin i objected but there was more hastings there occur often enough words spoken metaphorically which are taken literally the opposite can happen too in this case words which were meant literally were taken metaphorically young bleibner wrote plainly enough i am a leper but nobody realized that he shot himself because he believed that he had contracted the dread disease of leprosy what i ejaculated it was the clever invention of a diabolical mind young bleibner was suffering from some minor skin trouble he had lived in the south sea islands where the disease is common enough ames was a former friend of his and a wellknown medical man he would never dream of doubting his word when i arrived here my suspicions were divided between harper and dr ames but i soon realized that only the doctor could have perpetrated and concealed the crimes and i learnt from harper that he was previously acquainted with young bleibner doubtless the latter at some time or another had made a will or had insured his life in favour of the doctor the latter saw his chance of acquiring wealth it was easy for him to inoculate mr bleibner with the deadly germs then the nephew overcome with despair at the dread news his friend had conveyed to him shot himself mr bleibner whatever his intentions had made no will his fortune would pass to his nephew and from him to the doctor and mr schneider we cannot be sure he knew young bleibner too remember and may have suspected something or again the doctor may have thought that a further death motiveless and purposeless would strengthen the coils of superstition furthermore i will tell you an interesting psychological fact hastings a murderer has always a strong desire to repeat his successful crime the performance of it grows upon him hence my fears for young willard the figure of anubis you saw tonight was hassan dressed up by my orders i wanted to see if i could frighten the doctor but it would take more than the supernatural to frighten him i could see that he was not entirely taken in by my pretences of belief in the occult the little comedy i played for him did not deceive him i suspected that he would endeavour to make me the next victim ah but in spite of la mer maudite the heat abominable and the annoyances of the sand the little grey cells still functioned poirot proved to be perfectly right in his premises young bleibner some years ago in a fit of drunken merriment had made a jocular will leaving my cigarette case you admire so much and everything else of which i die possessed which will be principally debts to my good friend robert ames who once saved my life from drowning the case was hushed up as far as possible and to this day people talk of the remarkable series of deaths in connection with the tomb of menherra as a triumphal proof of the vengeance of a bygone king upon the desecrators of his tomba belief which as poirot pointed out to me is contrary to all egyptian belief and thought   vii   the jewel robbery at the grand metropolitan poirot i said a change of air would do you good you think so mon ami i am sure of it eheh said my friend smiling it is all arranged then you will come where do you propose to take me brighton as a matter of fact a friend of mine in the city put me on to a very good thing andwell i have money to burn as the saying goes i think a weekend at the grand metropolitan would do us all the good in the world thank you i accept most gratefully you have the good heart to think of an old man and the good heart it is in the end worth all the little grey cells yes yes i who speak to you am in danger of forgetting that sometimes i did not quite relish the implication i fancy that poirot is sometimes a little inclined to underestimate my mental capacities but his pleasure was so evident that i put my slight annoyance aside then thats all right i said hastily saturday evening saw us dining at the grand metropolitan in the midst of a gay throng all the world and his wife seemed to be at brighton the dresses were marvellous and the jewelsworn sometimes with more love of display than good tastewere something magnificent hein it is a sight this murmured poirot this is the home of the profiteer is it not so hastings supposed to be i replied but well hope they arent all tarred with the profiteering brush poirot gazed round him placidly the sight of so many jewels makes me wish i had turned my brains to crime instead of to its detection what a magnificent opportunity for some thief of distinction regard hastings that stout woman by the pillar she is as you would say plastered with gems i followed his eyes why i exclaimed its mrs opalsen you know her slightly her husband is a rich stockbroker who made a fortune in the recent oil boom after dinner we ran across the opalsens in the lounge and i introduced poirot to them we chatted for a few minutes and ended by having our coffee together poirot said a few words in praise of some of the costlier gems displayed on the ladys ample bosom and she brightened up at once its a perfect hobby of mine mr poirot i just love jewellery ed knows my weakness and every time things go well he brings me something new you are interested in precious stones i have had a good deal to do with them one time and another madame my profession has brought me into contact with some of the most famous jewels in the world he went on to narrate with discreet pseudonyms the story of the historic jewels of a reigning house and mrs opalsen listened with bated breath there now she exclaimed as he ended if it isnt just like a play you know ive got some pearls of my own that have a history attached to them i believe its supposed to be one of the finest necklaces in the worldthe pearls are so beautifully matched and so perfect in colour i declare i really must run up and get it oh madame protested poirot you are too amiable pray do not derange yourself oh but id like to show it to you the buxom dame waddled across to the lift briskly enough her husband who had been talking to me looked at poirot inquiringly madame your wife is so amiable as to insist on showing me her pearl necklace explained the latter oh the pearls opalsen smiled in a satisfied fashion well they are worth seeing cost a pretty penny too still the moneys there all right i could get what i paid for them any dayperhaps more may have to too if things go on as they are now moneys confoundedly tight in the city all this infernal epd he rambled on launching into technicalities where i could not follow him he was interrupted by a small pageboy who approached and murmured something in his ear ehwhat ill come at once not taken ill is she excuse me gentlemen he left us abruptly poirot leaned back and lit one of his tiny russian cigarettes then carefully and meticulously he arranged the empty coffeecups in a neat row and beamed happily on the result the minutes passed the opalsens did not return curious i remarked at length i wonder when they will come back poirot watched the ascending spirals of smoke and then said thoughtfully they will not come back why because my friend something has happened what sort of thing how do you know i asked curiously poirot smiled a few moments ago the manager came hurriedly out of his office and ran upstairs he was much agitated the liftboy is deep in talk with one of the pages the liftbell has rung three times but he heeds it not thirdly even the waiters are distrait and to make a waiter distrait poirot shook his head with an air of finality the affair must indeed be of the first magnitude ah it is as i thought here come the police two men had just entered the hotelone in uniform the other in plain clothes they spoke to a page and were immediately ushered upstairs a few minutes later the same boy descended and came up to where we were sitting mr opalsens compliments and would you step upstairs poirot sprang nimbly to his feet one would have said that he awaited the summons i followed with no less alacrity the opalsens apartments were situated on the first floor after knocking on the door the pageboy retired and we answered the summons come in a strange scene met our eyes the room was mrs opalsens bedroom and in the centre of it lying back in an armchair was the lady herself weeping violently she presented an extraordinary spectacle with the tears making great furrows in the powder with which her complexion was liberally coated mr opalsen was striding up and down angrily the two police officials stood in the middle of the room one with a notebook in hand an hotel chambermaid looking frightened to death stood by the fireplace and on the other side of the room a frenchwoman obviously mrs opalsens maid was weeping and wringing her hands with an intensity of grief that rivalled that of her mistress into this pandemonium stepped poirot neat and smiling immediately with an energy surprising in one of her bulk mrs opalsen sprang from her chair towards him there now ed may say what he likes but i believe in luck i do it was fated i should meet you the way i did this evening and ive a feeling that if you cant get my pearls back for me nobody can calm yourself i pray of you madame poirot patted her hand soothingly reassure yourself all will be well hercule poirot will aid you mr opalsen turned to the police inspector there will be no objection to myercalling in this gentleman i suppose none at all sir replied the man civilly but with complete indifference perhaps now your ladys feeling better shell just let us have the facts mrs opalsen looked helplessly at poirot he led her back to her chair seat yourself madame and recount to us the whole history without agitating yourself thus abjured mrs opalsen dried her eyes gingerly and began i came upstairs after dinner to fetch my pearls for mr poirot here to see the chambermaid and clestine were both in the room as usual excuse me madame but what do you mean by as usual mr opalsen explained i make it a rule that no one is to come into this room unless clestine the maid is there also the chambermaid does the room in the morning while clestine is present and comes in after dinner to turn down the beds under the same conditions otherwise she never enters the room well as i was saying continued mrs opalsen i came up i went to the drawer hereshe indicated the bottom righthand drawer of the kneehole dressingtabletook out my jewelcase and unlocked it it seemed quite as usualbut the pearls were not there the inspector had been busy with his notebook when had you last seen them he asked they were there when i went down to dinner you are sure quite sure i was uncertain whether to wear them or not but in the end i decided on the emeralds and put them back in the jewelcase who locked up the jewelcase i did i wear the key on a chain round my neck she held it up as she spoke the inspector examined it and shrugged his shoulders the thief must have had a duplicate key no difficult matter the lock is quite a simple one what did you do after youd locked the jewelcase i put it back in the bottom drawer where i always keep it you didnt lock the drawer no i never do my maid remains in the room till i come up so theres no need the inspectors face grew graver am i to understand that the jewels were there when you went down to dinner and that since then the maid has not left the room suddenly as though the horror of her own situation for the first time burst upon her clestine uttered a piercing shriek and flinging herself upon poirot poured out a torrent of incoherent french the suggestion was infamous that she should be suspected of robbing madame the police were well known to be of a stupidity incredible but monsieur who was a frenchman a belgian interjected poirot but clestine paid no attention to the correction monsieur would not stand by and see her falsely accused while that infamous chambermaid was allowed to go scotfree she had never liked hera bold redfaced thinga born thief she had said from the first that she was not honest and had kept a sharp watch over her too when she was doing madames room let those idiots of policemen search her and if they did not find madames pearls on her it would be very surprising although this harangue was uttered in rapid and virulent french clestine had interlarded it with a wealth of gesture and the chambermaid realized at least a part of her meaning she reddened angrily if that foreign womans saying i took the pearls its a lie she declared heatedly i never so much as saw them search her screamed the other you will find it is as i say youre a liardo you hear said the chambermaid advancing upon her stole em yourself and want to put it on me why i was only in the room about three minutes before the lady come up and then you were sitting here the whole time as you always do like a cat watching a mouse the inspector looked across inquiringly at clestine is that true didnt you leave the room at all i did not actually leave her alone admitted clestine reluctantly but i went into my own room through the door here twiceonce to fetch a reel of cotton and once for my scissors she must have done it then you wasnt gone a minute retorted the chambermaid angrily just popped out and in again id be glad if the police would search me ive nothing to be afraid of at this moment there was a tap at the door the inspector went to it his face brightened when he saw who it was ah he said thats rather fortunate i sent for one of our female searchers and shes just arrived perhaps if you wouldnt mind going into the room next door he looked at the chambermaid who stepped across the threshold with a toss of her head the searcher following her closely the french girl had sunk sobbing into a chair poirot was looking round the room the main features of which i have made clear by a sketch a sketch of the bedroom adjoining maids room and corridor where does that door lead he inquired nodding his head towards the one by the window into the next apartment i believe said the inspector its bolted anyway on this side poirot walked across to it tried it then drew back the bolt and tried it again and on the other side as well he remarked well that seems to rule out that he walked over to the windows examining each of them in turn and againnothing not even a balcony outside even if there were said the inspector impatiently i dont see how that would help us if the maid never left the room videmment said poirot not disconcerted as mademoiselle is positive she did not leave the room he was interrupted by the reappearance of the chambermaid and the police searcher nothing said the latter laconically i should hope not indeed said the chambermaid virtuously and that french hussy ought to be ashamed of herself taking away an honest girls character there there my girl thats all right said the inspector opening the door nobody suspects you you go along and get on with your work the chambermaid went unwillingly going to search her she demanded pointing at clestine yes yes he shut the door on her and turned the key clestine accompanied the searcher into the small room in her turn a few minutes later she also returned nothing had been found on her the inspectors face grew graver im afraid ill have to ask you to come along with me all the same miss he turned to mrs opalsen im sorry madam but all the evidence points that way if shes not got them on her theyre hidden somewhere about the room clestine uttered a piercing shriek and clung to poirots arm the latter bent and whispered something in the girls ear she looked up at him doubtfully si si mon enfanti assure you it is better not to resist then he turned to the inspector you permit monsieur a little experimentpurely for my own satisfaction depends on what it is replied the police officer noncommittally poirot addressed clestine once more you have told us that you went into your room to fetch a reel of cotton whereabouts was it on the top of the chest of drawers monsieur and the scissors they also would it be troubling you too much mademoiselle to ask you to repeat those two actions you were sitting here with your work you say clestine sat down and then at a sign from poirot rose passed into the adjoining room took up an object from the chest of drawers and returned poirot divided his attention between her movements and a large turnip of a watch which he held in the palm of his hand again if you please mademoiselle at the conclusion of the second performance he made a note in his pocketbook and returned the watch to his pocket thank you mademoiselle and you monsieurhe bowed to the inspectorfor your courtesy the inspector seemed somewhat entertained by this excessive politeness clestine departed in a flood of tears accompanied by the woman and the plainclothes official then with a brief apology to mrs opalsen the inspector set to work to ransack the room he pulled out drawers opened cupboards completely unmade the bed and tapped the floor mr opalsen looked on sceptically you really think you will find them yes sir it stands to reason she hadnt time to take them out of the room the ladys discovering the robbery so soon upset her plans no theyre here right enough one of the two must have hidden themand its very unlikely for the chambermaid to have done so more than unlikelyimpossible said poirot quietly eh the inspector stared poirot smiled modestly i will demonstrate hastings my good friend take my watch in your handwith care it is a family heirloom just now i timed mademoiselles movementsher first absence from the room was of twelve seconds her second of fifteen now observe my actions madame will have the kindness to give me the key of the jewelcase i thank you my friend hastings will have the kindness to say go go i said with almost incredible swiftness poirot wrenched open the drawer of the dressingtable extracted the jewelcase fitted the key in the lock opened the case selected a piece of jewellery shut and locked the case and returned it to the drawer which he pushed to again his movements were like lightning well mon ami he demanded of me breathlessly fortysix seconds i replied you see he looked round there would not have been time for the chambermaid even to take the necklace out far less hide it then that settles it on the maid said the inspector with satisfaction and returned to his search he passed into the maids bedroom next door poirot was frowning thoughtfully suddenly he shot a question at mr opalsen this necklaceit was without doubt insured mr opalsen looked a trifle surprised at the question yes he said hesitatingly that is so but what does that matter broke in mrs opalsen tearfully its my necklace i want it was unique no money could be the same i comprehend madame said poirot soothingly i comprehend perfectly to la femme sentiment is everythingis it not so but monsieur who has not the so fine susceptibility will doubtless find some slight consolation in the fact of course of course said mr opalsen rather uncertainly still he was interrupted by a shout of triumph from the inspector he came in dangling something from his fingers with a cry mrs opalsen heaved herself up from her chair she was a changed woman oh oh my necklace she clasped it to her breast with both hands we crowded round where was it demanded opalsen maids bed in among the springs of the wire mattress she must have stolen it and hidden it there before the chambermaid arrived on the scene you permit madame said poirot gently he took the necklace from her and examined it closely then handed it back with a bow im afraid madam youll have to hand it over to us for the time being said the inspector we shall want it for the charge but it shall be returned to you as soon as possible mr opalsen frowned is that necessary im afraid so sir just a formality oh let him take it ed cried his wife id feel safer if he did i shouldnt sleep a wink thinking some one else might try and get hold of it that wretched girl and i would never have believed it of her there there my dear dont take on so i felt a gentle pressure on my arm it was poirot shall we slip away my friend i think our services are no longer needed once outside however he hesitated and then much to my surprise he remarked i should rather like to see the room next door the door was not locked and we entered the room which was a large double one was unoccupied dust lay about rather noticeably and my sensitive friend gave a characteristic grimace as he ran his finger round a rectangular mark on a table near the window the service leaves to be desired he observed dryly he was staring thoughtfully out of the window and seemed to have fallen into a brown study well i demanded impatiently what did we come in here for he started je vous demande pardon mon ami i wished to see if the door was really bolted on this side also well i said glancing at the door which communicated with the room we had just left it is bolted poirot nodded he still seemed to be thinking and anyway i continued what does it matter the case is over i wish youd had more chance of distinguishing yourself but it was the kind of case that even a stiffbacked idiot like that inspector couldnt go wrong over poirot shook his head the case is not over my friend it will not be over until we find out who stole the pearls but the maid did why do you say that why i stammered they were foundactually in her mattress ta ta ta said poirot impatiently those were not the pearls what imitation mon ami the statement took my breath away poirot was smiling placidly the good inspector obviously knows nothing of jewels but presently there will be a fine hullabaloo come i cried dragging at his arm where we must tell the opalsens at once i think not but that poor woman eh bien that poor woman as you call her will have a much better night believing the jewels to be safe but the thief may escape with them as usual my friend you speak without reflection how do you know that the pearls mrs opalsen locked up so carefully tonight were not the false ones and that the real robbery did not take place at a much earlier date oh i said bewildered exactly said poirot beaming we start again he led the way out of the room paused a moment as though considering and then walked down to the end of the corridor stopping outside the small den where the chambermaids and valets of the respective floors congregated our particular chambermaid appeared to be holding a small court there and to be retailing her late experiences to an appreciative audience she stopped in the middle of a sentence poirot bowed with his usual politeness excuse that i derange you but i shall be obliged if you will unlock for me the door of mr opalsens room the woman rose willingly and we accompanied her down the passage again mr opalsens room was on the other side of the corridor its door facing that of his wifes room the chambermaid unlocked it with her passkey and we entered as she was about to depart poirot detained her one moment have you ever seen among the effects of mr opalsen a card like this he held out a plain white card rather highly glazed and uncommon in appearance the maid took it and scrutinized it carefully no sir i cant say i have but anyway the valet has most to do with the gentlemens rooms i see thank you poirot took back the card the woman departed poirot appeared to reflect a little then he gave a short sharp nod of the head ring the bell i pray of you hastings three times for the valet i obeyed devoured with curiosity meanwhile poirot had emptied the wastepaperbasket on the floor and was swiftly going through its contents in a few moments the valet answered the bell to him poirot put the same question and handed him the card to examine but the response was the same the valet had never seen a card of that particular quality among mr opalsens belongings poirot thanked him and he withdrew somewhat unwillingly with an inquisitive glance at the overturned wastepaperbasket and the litter on the floor he could hardly have helped overhearing poirots thoughtful remark as he bundled the torn papers back again and the necklace was heavily insured    poirot i cried  i see you see nothing my friend he replied quickly as usual nothing at all it is incrediblebut there it is let us return to our own apartments we did so in silence once there to my intense surprise poirot effected a rapid change of clothing i go to london tonight he explained it is imperative what absolutely the real work that of the brain ah those brave little grey cells it is done i go to seek the confirmation i shall find it impossible to deceive hercule poirot youll come a cropper one of these days i observed rather disgusted by his vanity do not be enraged i beg of you mon ami i count on you to do me a serviceof your friendship of course i said eagerly rather ashamed of my moroseness what is it the sleeve of my coat that i have taken offwill you brush it see you a little white powder has clung to it you without doubt observed me run my finger round the drawer of the dressingtable no i didnt you should observe my actions my friend thus i obtained the powder on my finger and being a little overexcited i rubbed it on my sleeve an action without method which i deplorefalse to all my principles but what was the powder i asked not particularly interested in poirots principles not the poison of the borgias replied poirot with a twinkle i see your imagination mounting i should say it was french chalk french chalk yes cabinetmakers use it to make drawers run smoothly i laughed you old sinner i thought you were working up to something exciting au revoir my friend i save myself i fly the door shut behind him with a smile half of derision half of affection i picked up the coat and stretched out my hand for the clothesbrush                      the next morning hearing nothing from poirot i went out for a stroll met some old friends and lunched with them at their hotel in the afternoon we went for a spin a punctured tyre delayed us and it was past eight when i got back to the grand metropolitan the first sight that met my eyes was poirot looking even more diminutive than usual sandwiched between the opalsens beaming in a state of placid satisfaction mon ami hastings he cried and sprang to meet me embrace me my friend all has marched to a marvel luckily the embrace was merely figurativenot a thing one is always sure of with poirot do you mean i began just wonderful i call it said mrs opalsen smiling all over her fat face didnt i tell you ed that if he couldnt get back my pearls nobody would you did my dear you did and you were right i looked helplessly at poirot and he answered the glance my friend hastings is as you say in england all at the seaside seat yourself and i will recount to you all the affair that has so happily ended ended but yes they are arrested who are arrested the chambermaid and the valet parbleu you did not suspect not with my parting hint about the french chalk you said cabinetmakers used it certainly they doto make drawers slide easily somebody wanted that drawer to slide in and out without any noise who could that be obviously only the chambermaid the plan was so ingenious that it did not at once leap to the eyenot even to the eye of hercule poirot listen this was how it was done the valet was in the empty room next door waiting the french maid leaves the room quick as a flash the chambermaid whips open the drawer takes out the jewelcase and slipping back the bolt passes it through the door the valet opens it at his leisure with the duplicate key with which he has provided himself extracts the necklace and waits his time clestine leaves the room again andpstin a flash the case is passed back again and replaced in the drawer madame arrives the theft is discovered the chambermaid demands to be searched with a good deal of righteous indignation and leaves the room without a stain on her character the imitation necklace with which they have provided themselves has been concealed in the french girls bed that morning by the chambermaida master stroke a but what did you go to london for you remember the card certainly it puzzled meand puzzles me still i thought i hesitated delicately glancing at mr opalsen poirot laughed heartily une blague for the benefit of the valet the card was one with a specially prepared surfacefor fingerprints i went straight to scotland yard asked for our old friend inspector japp and laid the facts before him as i had suspected the fingerprints proved to be those of two wellknown jewel thieves who have been wanted for some time japp came down with me the thieves were arrested and the necklace was discovered in the valets possession a clever pair but they failed in method have i not told you hastings at least thirtysix times that without method at least thirtysix thousand times i interrupted but where did their method break down mon ami it is a good plan to take a place as chambermaid or valetbut you must not shirk your work they left an empty room undusted and therefore when the man put down the jewelcase on the little table near the communicating door it left a square mark i remember i cried before i was undecided theni knew there was a moments silence and ive got my pearls said mrs opalsen as a sort of greek chorus well i said id better have some dinner poirot accompanied me this ought to mean kudos for you i observed pas du tout replied poirot tranquilly japp and the local inspector will divide the credit between them buthe tapped his pocketi have a cheque here from mr opalsen and how say you my friend this weekend has not gone according to plan shall we return here next weekendat my expense this time   viii   the kidnapped prime minister now that war and the problems of war are things of the past i think i may safely venture to reveal to the world the part which my friend poirot played in a moment of national crisis the secret has been well guarded not a whisper of it reached the press but now that the need for secrecy has gone by i feel it is only just that england should know the debt it owes to my quaint little friend whose marvellous brain so ably averted a great catastrophe one evening after dinneri will not particularize the date it suffices to say that it was at the time when peace by negotiation was the parrotcry of englands enemiesmy friend and i were sitting in his rooms after being invalided out of the army i had been given a recruiting job and it had become my custom to drop in on poirot in the evenings after dinner and talk with him of any cases of interest that he might have on hand i was attempting to discuss with him the sensational news of that dayno less than an attempted assassination of mr david macadam englands prime minister the account in the papers had evidently been carefully censored no details were given save that the prime minister had had a marvellous escape the bullet just grazing his cheek i considered that our police must have been shamefully careless for such an outrage to be possible i could well understand that the german agents in england would be willing to risk much for such an achievement fighting mac as his own party had nicknamed him had strenuously and unequivocally combated the pacifist influence which was becoming so prevalent he was more than englands prime ministerhe was england and to have removed him from his sphere of influence would have been a crushing and paralysing blow to britain poirot was busy mopping a grey suit with a minute sponge never was there a dandy such as hercule poirot neatness and order were his passion now with the odour of benzine filling the air he was quite unable to give me his full attention in a little minute i am with you my friend i have all but finished the spot of greasehe is not goodi remove himso he waved his sponge i smiled as i lit another cigarette anything interesting on i inquired after a minute or two i assist ahow do you call itcharlady to find her husband a difficult affair needing the tact for i have a little idea that when he is found he will not be pleased what would you for my part i sympathize with him he was a man of discrimination to lose himself i laughed at last the spot of grease he is gone i am at your disposal i was asking you what you thought of this attempt to assassinate macadam enfantillage replied poirot promptly one can hardly take it seriously to fire with the riflenever does it succeed it is a device of the past it was very near succeeding this time i reminded him poirot shook his head impatiently he was about to reply when the landlady thrust her head round the door and informed him that there were two gentlemen below who wanted to see him they wont give their names sir but they says as its very important let them mount said poirot carefully folding his grey trousers in a few minutes the two visitors were ushered in and my heart gave a leap as in the foremost i recognized no less a personage than lord estair leader of the house of commons whilst his companion mr bernard dodge was also a member of the war cabinet and as i knew a close personal friend of the prime minister monsieur poirot said lord estair interrogatively my friend bowed the great man looked at me and hesitated my business is private you may speak freely before captain hastings said my friend nodding to me to remain he has not all the gifts no but i answer for his discretion lord estair still hesitated but mr dodge broke in abruptly oh come ondont lets beat about the bush as far as i can see the whole of england will know the hole were in soon enough times everything pray be seated messieurs said poirot politely will you take the big chair milord lord estair started slightly you know me poirot smiled certainly i read the little papers with the pictures how should i not know you monsieur poirot i have come to consult you upon a matter of the most vital urgency i must ask for absolute secrecy you have the word of hercule poiroti can say no more said my friend grandiloquently it concerns the prime minister we are in grave trouble were up a tree interposed mr dodge the injury is serious then i asked what injury the bullet wound oh that cried mr dodge contemptuously thats old history as my colleague says continued lord estair that affair is over and done with luckily it failed i wished i could say as much for the second attempt there has been a second attempt then yes though not of the same nature monsieur poirot the prime minister has disappeared what he has been kidnapped impossible i cried stupefied poirot threw a withering glance at me which i knew enjoined me to keep my mouth shut unfortunately impossible as it seems it is only too true continued his lordship poirot looked at mr dodge you said just now monsieur that time was everything what did you mean by that the two men exchanged glances and then lord estair said you have heard monsieur poirot of the approaching allied conference my friend nodded for obvious reasons no details have been given of when and where it is to take place but although it has been kept out of the newspapers the date is of course widely known in diplomatic circles the conference is to be held tomorrowthursdayevening at versailles now you perceive the terrible gravity of the situation i will not conceal from you that the prime ministers presence at the conference is a vital necessity the pacifist propaganda started and maintained by the german agents in our midst has been very active it is the universal opinion that the turning point of the conference will be the strong personality of the prime minister his absence may have the most serious resultspossibly a premature and disastrous peace and we have no one who can be sent in his place he alone can represent england poirots face had grown very grave then you regard the kidnapping of the prime minister as a direct attempt to prevent his being present at the conference most certainly i do he was actually on his way to france at the time and the conference is to be held at nine oclock tomorrow night poirot drew an enormous watch from his pocket it is now a quarter to nine twentyfour hours said mr dodge thoughtfully and a quarter amended poirot do not forget the quarter monsieurit may come in useful now for the detailsthe abduction did it take place in england or in france in france mr macadam crossed to france this morning he was to stay tonight as the guest of the commanderinchief proceeding tomorrow to paris he was conveyed across the channel by destroyer at boulogne he was met by a car from general headquarters and one of the commanderinchiefs adcs eh bien well they started from boulognebut they never arrived what monsieur poirot it was a bogus car and a bogus adc the real car was found in a side road with the chauffeur and the adc neatly gagged and bound and the bogus car is still at large poirot made a gesture of impatience incredible surely it cannot escape attention for long so we thought it seemed merely a question of searching thoroughly that part of france is under military law we were convinced that the car could not go long unnoticed the french police and our own scotland yard men and the military are straining every nerve it is as you say incrediblebut nothing has been discovered at that moment a tap came at the door and a young officer entered with a heavily sealed envelope which he handed to lord estair just through from france sir i brought it on here as you directed the minister tore it open eagerly and uttered an exclamation the officer withdrew here is news at last this telegram has just been decoded they have found the second car also the secretary daniels chloroformed gagged and bound in an abandoned farm near c he remembers nothing except something being pressed against his mouth and nose from behind and struggling to free himself the police are satisfied as to the genuineness of his statement and they have found nothing else no not the prime ministers dead body then there is hope but it is strange why after trying to shoot him this morning are they now taking so much trouble to keep him alive dodge shook his head one things quite certain theyre determined at all costs to prevent his attending the conference if it is humanly possible the prime minister shall be there god grant it is not too late now messieurs recount to me everythingfrom the beginning i must know about this shooting affair as well last night the prime minister accompanied by one of his secretaries captain daniels the same who accompanied him to france yes as i was saying they motored down to windsor where the prime minister was granted an audience early this morning he returned to town and it was on the way that the attempted assassination took place one moment if you please who is this captain daniels you have his dossier lord estair smiled i thought you would ask me that we do not know very much of him he is of no particular family he has served in the english army and is an extremely able secretary being an exceptionally fine linguist i believe he speaks seven languages it is for that reason that the prime minister chose him to accompany him to france has he any relatives in england two aunts a mrs everard who lives at hampstead and a miss daniels who lives near ascot ascot that is near to windsor is it not that point has not been overlooked but it has led to nothing you regard the capitaine daniels then as above suspicion a shade of bitterness crept into lord estairs voice as he replied no monsieur poirot in these days i should hesitate before i pronounced anyone above suspicion trs bien now i understand milord that the prime minister would as a matter of course be under vigilant police protection which ought to render any assault upon him an impossibility lord estair bowed his head that is so the prime ministers car was closely followed by another car containing detectives in plain clothes mr macadam knew nothing of these precautions he is personally a most fearless man and would be inclined to sweep them away arbitrarily but naturally the police make their own arrangements in fact the premiers chauffeur omurphy is a cid man omurphy that is a name of ireland is it not so yes he is an irishman from what part of ireland county clare i believe tiens but proceed milord the premier started for london the car was a closed one he and captain daniels sat inside the second car followed as usual but unluckily for some unknown reason the prime ministers car deviated from the main road at a point where the road curves interrupted poirot yesbut how did you know oh cest vident continue for some unknown reason continued lord estair the premiers car left the main road the police car unaware of the deviation continued to keep to the high road at a short distance down the unfrequented lane the prime ministers car was suddenly held up by a band of masked men the chauffeur that brave omurphy murmured poirot thoughtfully the chauffeur momentarily taken aback jammed on the brakes the prime minister put his head out of the window instantly a shot rang outthen another the first one grazed his cheek the second fortunately went wide the chauffeur now realizing the danger instantly forged straight ahead scattering the band of men a near escape i ejaculated with a shiver mr macadam refused to make any fuss over the slight wound he had received he declared it was only a scratch he stopped at a local cottage hospital where it was dressed and bound uphe did not of course reveal his identity he then drove as per schedule straight to charing cross where a special train for dover was awaiting him and after a brief account of what had happened had been given to the anxious police by captain daniels he duly departed for france at dover he went on board the waiting destroyer at boulogne as you know the bogus car was waiting for him carrying the union jack and correct in every detail that is all you have to tell me yes there is no other circumstance that you have omitted milord well there is one rather peculiar thing yes the prime ministers car did not return home after leaving the prime minister at charing cross the police were anxious to interview omurphy so a search was instituted at once the car was discovered standing outside a certain unsavoury little restaurant in soho which is well known as a meetingplace of german agents and the chauffeur the chauffeur was nowhere to be found he too had disappeared so said poirot thoughtfully there are two disappearances the prime minister in france and omurphy in london he looked keenly at lord estair who made a gesture of despair i can only tell you monsieur poirot that if anyone had suggested to me yesterday that omurphy was a traitor i should have laughed in his face and today today i do not know what to think poirot nodded gravely he looked at his turnip of a watch again i understand that i have carte blanche messieursin every way i mean i must be able to go where i choose and how i choose perfectly there is a special train leaving for dover in an hours time with a further contingent from scotland yard you shall be accompanied by a military officer and a cid man who will hold themselves at your disposal in every way is that satisfactory quite one more question before you leave messieurs what made you come to me i am unknown obscure in this great london of yours we sought you out on the express recommendation and wish of a very great man of your own country comment my old friend the prfet lord estair shook his head one higher than the prfet one whose word was once law in belgiumand shall be again that england has sworn poirots hand flew swiftly to a dramatic salute amen to that ah but my master does not forget    messieurs i hercule poirot will serve you faithfully heaven only send that it will be in time but this is darkdark    i cannot see well poirot i cried impatiently as the door closed behind the ministers what do you think my friend was busy packing a minute suitcase with quick deft movements he shook his head thoughtfully i do not know what to think my brains desert me why as you said kidnap him when a knock on the head would do as well i mused pardon me mon ami but i did not quite say that it is undoubtedly far more their affair to kidnap him but why because uncertainty creates panic that is one reason were the prime minister dead it would be a terrible calamity but the situation would have to be faced but now you have paralysis will the prime minister reappear or will he not is he dead or alive nobody knows and until they know nothing definite can be done and as i tell you uncertainty breeds panic which is what les boches are playing for then again if the kidnappers are holding him secretly somewhere they have the advantage of being able to make terms with both sides the german government is not a liberal paymaster as a rule but no doubt they can be made to disgorge substantial remittances in such a case as this thirdly they run no risk of the hangmans rope oh decidedly kidnapping is their affair then if that is so why should they first try to shoot him poirot made a gesture of anger ah that is just what i do not understand it is inexplicablestupid they have all their arrangements made and very good arrangements too for the abduction and yet they imperil the whole affair by a melodramatic attack worthy of a cinema and quite as unreal it is almost impossible to believe in it with its band of masked men not twenty miles from london perhaps they were two quite separate attempts which happened irrespective of each other i suggested ah no that would be too much of a coincidence then furtherwho is the traitor there must have been a traitorin the first affair anyway but who was itdaniels or omurphy it must have been one of the two or why did the car leave the main road we cannot suppose that the prime minister connived at his own assassination did omurphy take that turning of his own accord or was it daniels who told him to do so surely it must have been omurphys doing yes because if it was daniels the prime minister would have heard the order and would have asked the reason but there are altogether too many whys in this affair and they contradict each other if omurphy is an honest man why did he leave the main road but if he was a dishonest man why did he start the car again when only two shots had been firedthereby in all probability saving the prime ministers life and again if he was honest why did he immediately on leaving charing cross drive to a wellknown rendezvous of german spies it looks bad i said let us look at the case with method what have we for and against these two men take omurphy first against that his conduct in leaving the main road was suspicious that he is an irishman from county clare that he has disappeared in a highly suggestive manner for that his promptness in restarting the car saved the premiers life that he is a scotland yard man and obviously from the post allotted to him a trusted detective now for daniels there is not much against him except the fact that nothing is known of his antecedents and that he speaks too many languages for a good englishman pardon me mon ami but as linguists you are deplorable now for him we have the fact that he was found gagged bound and chloroformedwhich does not look as though he had anything to do with the matter he might have gagged and bound himself to divert suspicion poirot shook his head the french police would make no mistake of that kind besides once he had attained his object and the prime minister was safely abducted there would not be much point in his remaining behind his accomplices could have gagged and chloroformed him of course but i fail to see what object they hoped to accomplish by it he can be of little use to them now for until the circumstances concerning the prime minister have been cleared up he is bound to be closely watched perhaps he hoped to start the police on a false scent then why did he not do so he merely says that something was pressed over his nose and mouth and that he remembers nothing more there is no false scent there it sounds remarkably like the truth well i said glancing at the clock i suppose wed better start for the station you may find more clues in france possibly mon ami but i doubt it it is still incredible to me that the prime minister has not been discovered in that limited area where the difficulty of concealing him must be tremendous if the military and the police of two countries have not found him how shall i at charing cross we were met by mr dodge this is detective barnes of scotland yard and major norman they will hold themselves entirely at your disposal good luck to you its a bad business but ive not given up hope must be off now and the minister strode rapidly away we chatted in a desultory fashion with major norman in the centre of the little group of men on the platform i recognized a little ferretfaced fellow talking to a tall fair man he was an old acquaintance of poirotsdetectiveinspector japp supposed to be one of the smartest of scotland yards officers he came over and greeted my friend cheerfully i heard you were on this job too smart bit of work so far theyve got away with the goods all right but i cant believe they can keep him hidden long our people are going through france with a toothcomb so are the french i cant help feeling its only a matter of hours now that is if hes still alive remarked the tall detective gloomily japps face fell yes    but somehow ive got the feeling hes alive all right poirot nodded yes yes hes alive but can he be found in time i like you did not believe he could be hidden so long the whistle blew and we all trooped up into the pullman car then with a slow unwilling jerk the train drew out of the station it was a curious journey the scotland yard men crowded together maps of northern france were spread out and eager forefingers traced the lines of roads and villages each man had his own pet theory poirot showed none of his usual loquacity but sat staring in front of him with an expression on his face that reminded me of a puzzled child i talked to norman whom i found quite an amusing fellow on arriving at dover poirots behaviour moved me to intense amusement the little man as he went on board the boat clutched desperately at my arm the wind was blowing lustily mon dieu he murmured this is terrible have courage poirot i cried you will succeed you will find him i am sure of it ah mon ami you mistake my emotion it is this villainous sea that troubles me the mal de merit is horrible suffering oh i said rather taken aback the first throb of the engines was felt and poirot groaned and closed his eyes major norman has a map of northern france if you would like to study it poirot shook his head impatiently but no but no leave me my friend see you to think the stomach and the brain must be in harmony laverguier has a method most excellent for averting the mal de mer you breathe inand outslowly soturning the head from left to right and counting six between each breath i left him to his gymnastic endeavours and went on deck as we came slowly into boulogne harbour poirot appeared neat and smiling and announced to me in a whisper that laverguiers system had succeeded to a marvel japps forefinger was still tracing imaginary routes on his map nonsense the car started from boulognehere they branched off now my idea is that they transferred the prime minister to another car see well said the tall detective i shall make for the seaports ten to one theyve smuggled him on board a ship japp shook his head too obvious the order went out at once to close all the ports the day was just breaking as we landed major norman touched poirot on the arm theres a military car here waiting for you sir thank you monsieur but for the moment i do not propose to leave boulogne what no we will enter this hotel here by the quay he suited the action to the word demanded and was accorded a private room we three followed him puzzled and uncomprehending he shot a quick glance at us it is not so that the good detective should act eh i perceive your thought he must be full of energy he must rush to and fro he should prostrate himself on the dusty road and seek the marks of tyres through a little glass he must gather up the cigaretteend the fallen match that is your idea is it not his eyes challenged us but ihercule poirottell you that it is not so the true clues are withinhere he tapped his forehead see you i need not have left london it would have been sufficient for me to sit quietly in my rooms there all that matters is the little grey cells within secretly and silently they do their part until suddenly i call for a map and i lay my finger on a spotsoand i say the prime minister is there and it is so with method and logic one can accomplish anything this frantic rushing to france was a mistakeit is playing a childs game of hideandseek but now though it may be too late i will set to work the right way from within silence my friends i beg of you and for five long hours the little man sat motionless blinking his eyelids like a cat his green eyes flickering and becoming steadily greener and greener the scotland yard man was obviously contemptuous major norman was bored and impatient and i myself found the time pass with wearisome slowness finally i got up and strolled as noiselessly as i could to the window the matter was becoming a farce i was secretly concerned for my friend if he failed i would have preferred him to fail in a less ridiculous manner out of the window i idly watched the daily leave boat belching forth columns of smoke as she lay alongside the quay suddenly i was aroused by poirots voice close to my elbow mes amis let us start i turned an extraordinary transformation had come over my friend his eyes were flickering with excitement his chest was swelled to the uttermost i have been an imbecile my friends but i see daylight at last major norman moved hastily to the door ill order the car there is no need i shall not use it thank heaven the wind has fallen do you mean you are going to walk sir no my young friend i am no st peter i prefer to cross the sea by boat to cross the sea yes to work with method one must begin from the beginning and the beginning of this affair was in england therefore we return to england                      at three oclock we stood once more upon charing cross platform to all our expostulations poirot turned a deaf ear and reiterated again and again that to start at the beginning was not a waste of time but the only way on the way over he had conferred with norman in a low voice and the latter had despatched a sheaf of telegrams from dover owing to the special passes held by norman we got through everywhere in record time in london a large police car was waiting for us with some plainclothes men one of whom handed a typewritten sheet of paper to my friend he answered my inquiring glance a list of the cottage hospitals within a certain radius west of london i wired for it from dover we were whirled rapidly through the london streets we were on the bath road on we went through hammersmith chiswick and brentford i began to see our objective through windsor and on to ascot my heart gave a leap ascot was where daniels had an aunt living we were after him then not omurphy we duly stopped at the gate of a trim villa poirot jumped out and rang the bell i saw a perplexed frown dimming the radiance of his face plainly he was not satisfied the bell was answered he was ushered inside in a few moments he reappeared and climbed into the car with a short sharp shake of his head my hopes began to die down it was past four now even if he found certain evidence incriminating daniels what would be the good of it unless he could wring from some one the exact spot in france where they were holding the prime minister our return progress towards london was an interrupted one we deviated from the main road more than once and occasionally stopped at a small building which i had no difficulty in recognizing as a cottage hospital poirot only spent a few minutes at each but at every halt his radiant assurance was more and more restored he whispered something to norman to which the latter replied yes if you turn off to the left you will find them waiting by the bridge we turned up a side road and in the failing light i discerned a second car waiting by the side of the road it contained two men in plain clothes poirot got down and spoke to them and then we started off in a northerly direction the other car following close behind we drove for some time our objective being obviously one of the northern suburbs of london finally we drove up to the front door of a tall house standing a little back from the road in its own grounds norman and i were left with the car poirot and one of the detectives went up to the door and rang a neat parlourmaid opened it the detective spoke i am a police officer and i have a warrant to search this house the girl gave a little scream and a tall handsome woman of middleage appeared behind her in the hall shut the door edith they are burglars i expect but poirot swiftly inserted his foot in the door and at the same moment blew a whistle instantly the other detectives ran up and poured into the house shutting the door behind them norman and i spent about five minutes cursing our forced inactivity finally the door reopened and the men emerged escorting three prisonersa woman and two men the woman and one of the men were taken to the second car the other man was placed in our car by poirot himself i must go with the others my friend but have great care of this gentleman you do not know him no eh bien let me present to you monsieur omurphy omurphy i gaped at him openmouthed as we started again he was not handcuffed but i did not fancy he would try to escape he sat there staring in front of him as though dazed anyway norman and i would be more than a match for him to my surprise we still kept a northerly route we were not returning to london then i was much puzzled suddenly as the car slowed down i recognized that we were close to hendon aerodrome immediately i grasped poirots idea he proposed to reach france by aeroplane it was a sporting idea but on the face of it impracticable a telegram would be far quicker time was everything he must leave the personal glory of rescuing the prime minister to others as we drew up major norman jumped out and a plainclothes man took his place he conferred with poirot for a few minutes and then went off briskly i too jumped out and caught poirot by the arm i congratulate you old fellow they have told you the hidingplace but look here you must wire to france at once youll be too late if you go yourself poirot looked at me curiously for a minute or two unfortunately my friend there are some things that cannot be sent by telegram                      at that moment major norman returned accompanied by a young officer in the uniform of the flying corps this is captain lyall who will fly you over to france he can start at once wrap up warmly sir said the young pilot i can lend you a coat if you like poirot was consulting his enormous watch he murmured to himself yes there is timejust time then he looked up and bowed politely to the young officer i thank you monsieur but it is not i who am your passenger it is this gentleman here he moved a little aside as he spoke and a figure came forward out of the darkness it was the second male prisoner who had gone in the other car and as the light fell on his face i gave a gasp of surprise it was the prime minister                      for heavens sake tell me all about it i cried impatiently as poirot norman and i motored back to london how in the world did they manage to smuggle him back to england there was no need to smuggle him back replied poirot dryly the prime minister has never left england he was kidnapped on his way from windsor to london what i will make all clear the prime minister was in his car his secretary beside him suddenly a pad of chloroform is clapped on his face but by whom by the clever linguistic captain daniels as soon as the prime minister is unconscious daniels picks up the speakingtube and directs omurphy to turn to the right which the chauffeur quite unsuspicious does a few yards down that unfrequented road a large car is standing apparently broken down its driver signals to omurphy to stop omurphy slows up the stranger approaches daniels leans out of the window and probably with the aid of an instantaneous ansthetic such as ethylchloride the chloroform trick is repeated in a few seconds the two helpless men are dragged out and transferred to the other car and a pair of substitutes take their places impossible pas du tout have you not seen musichall turns imitating celebrities with marvellous accuracy nothing is easier than to personate a public character the prime minister of england is far easier to understudy than mr john smith of clapham say as for omurphys double no one was going to take much notice of him until after the departure of the prime minister and by then he would have made himself scarce he drives straight from charing cross to the meetingplace of his friends he goes in as omurphy he emerges as some one quite different omurphy has disappeared leaving a conveniently suspicious trail behind him but the man who personated the prime minister was seen by every one he was not seen by anyone who knew him privately or intimately and daniels shielded him from contact with anyone as much as possible moreover his face was bandaged up and anything unusual in his manner would be put down to the fact that he was suffering from shock as a result of the attempt upon his life mr macadam has a weak throat and always spares his voice as much as possible before any great speech the deception was perfectly easy to keep up as far as france there it would be impracticable and impossibleso the prime minister disappears the police of this country hurry across the channel and no one bothers to go into the details of the first attack to sustain the illusion that the abduction has taken place in france daniels is gagged and chloroformed in a convincing manner and the man who has enacted the part of the prime minister rids himself of his disguise he and the bogus chauffeur may be arrested as suspicious characters but no one will dream of suspecting their real part in the drama and they will eventually be released for lack of evidence and the real prime minister he and omurphy were driven straight to the house of mrs everard at hampstead daniels socalled aunt in reality she is frau bertha ebenthal and the police have been looking for her for some time it is a valuable little present that i have made to themto say nothing of daniels ah it was a clever plan but he did not reckon on the cleverness of hercule poirot i think my friend might well be excused his moment of vanity when did you first begin to suspect the truth of the matter when i began to work the right wayfrom within i could not make that shooting affair fit inbut when i saw that the net result of it was that the prime minister went to france with his face bound up i began to comprehend and when i visited all the cottage hospitals between windsor and london and found that no one answering to my description had had his face bound up and dressed that morning i was sure after that it was childsplay for a mind like mine                      the following morning poirot showed me a telegram he had just received it had no place of origin and was unsigned it ran in time later in the day the evening papers published an account of the allied conference they laid particular stress on the magnificent ovation accorded to mr david macadam whose inspiring speech had produced a deep and lasting impression   ix   the disappearance of mr davenheim poirot and i were expecting our old friend inspector japp of scotland yard to tea we were sitting round the teatable awaiting his arrival poirot had just finished carefully straightening the cups and saucers which our landlady was in the habit of throwing rather than placing on the table he had also breathed heavily on the metal teapot and polished it with a silk handkerchief the kettle was on the boil and a small enamel saucepan beside it contained some thick sweet chocolate which was more to poirots palate than what he described as your english poison a sharp rattat sounded below and a few minutes afterwards japp entered briskly hope im not late he said as he greeted us to tell the truth i was yarning with miller the man whos in charge of the davenheim case i pricked up my ears for the last three days the papers had been full of the strange disappearance of mr davenheim senior partner of davenheim and salmon the wellknown bankers and financiers on saturday last he had walked out of his house and had never been seen since i looked forward to extracting some interesting details from japp i should have thought i remarked that it would be almost impossible for anyone to disappear nowadays poirot moved a plate of bread and butter the eighth of an inch and said sharply be exact my friend what do you mean by disappear to which class of disappearance are you referring are disappearances classified and labelled then i laughed japp smiled also poirot frowned at us both but certainly they are they fall into three categories first and most common the voluntary disappearance second the much abused loss of memory caserare but occasionally genuine third murder and a more or less successful disposal of the body do you refer to all three as impossible of execution very nearly so i should think you might lose your own memory but some one would be sure to recognize youespecially in the case of a wellknown man like davenheim then bodies cant be made to vanish into thin air sooner or later they turn up concealed in lonely places or in trunks murder will out in the same way the absconding clerk or the domestic defaulter is bound to be run down in these days of wireless telegraphy he can be headed off from foreign countries ports and railway stations are watched and as for concealment in this country his features and appearance will be known to every one who reads a daily newspaper hes up against civilization mon ami said poirot you make one error you do not allow for the fact that a man who had decided to make away with another manor with himself in a figurative sensemight be that rare machine a man of method he might bring intelligence talent a careful calculation of detail to the task and then i do not see why he should not be successful in baffling the police force but not you i suppose said japp goodhumouredly winking at me he couldnt baffle you eh monsieur poirot poirot endeavoured with a marked lack of success to look modest me also why not it is true that i approach such problems with an exact science a mathematical precision which seems alas only too rare in the new generation of detectives japp grinned more widely i dont know he said miller the man whos on this case is a smart chap you may be very sure he wont overlook a footprint or a cigarash or a crumb even hes got eyes that see everything so mon ami said poirot has the london sparrow but all the same i should not ask the little brown bird to solve the problem of mr davenheim come now monsieur youre not going to run down the value of details as clues by no means these things are all good in their way the danger is they may assume undue importance most details are insignificant one or two are vital it is the brain the little grey cellshe tapped his foreheadon which one must rely the senses mislead one must seek the truth withinnot without you dont mean to say monsieur poirot that you would undertake to solve a case without moving from your chair do you that is exactly what i do meangranted the facts were placed before me i regard myself as a consulting specialist japp slapped his knee hanged if i dont take you at your word bet you a fiver that you cant lay your handor rather tell me where to lay my handon mr davenheim dead or alive before a week is out poirot considered eh bien mon ami i accept le sport it is the passion of you english nowthe facts on saturday last as is his usual custom mr davenheim took the  train from victoria to chingside where his palatial country place the cedars is situated after lunch he strolled round the grounds and gave various directions to the gardeners everybody agrees that his manner was absolutely normal and as usual after tea he put his head into his wifes boudoir saying that he was going to stroll down to the village and post some letters he added that he was expecting a mr lowen on business if he should come before he himself returned he was to be shown into the study and asked to wait mr davenheim then left the house by the front door passed leisurely down the drive and out at the gate andwas never seen again from that hour he vanished completely prettyvery prettyaltogether a charming little problem murmured poirot proceed my good friend about a quarter of an hour later a tall dark man with a thick black moustache rang the frontdoor bell and explained that he had an appointment with mr davenheim he gave the name of lowen and in accordance with the bankers instructions was shown into the study nearly an hour passed mr davenheim did not return finally mr lowen rang the bell and explained that he was unable to wait any longer as he must catch his train back to town mrs davenheim apologized for her husbands absence which seemed unaccountable as she knew him to have been expecting the visitor mr lowen reiterated his regrets and took his departure well as every one knows mr davenheim did not return early on sunday morning the police were communicated with but could make neither head nor tail of the matter mr davenheim seemed literally to have vanished into thin air he had not been to the post office nor had he been seen passing through the village at the station they were positive he had not departed by any train his own motor had not left the garage if he had hired a car to meet him in some lonely spot it seems almost certain that by this time in view of the large reward offered for information the driver of it would have come forward to tell what he knew true there was a small racemeeting at entfield five miles away and if he had walked to that station he might have passed unnoticed in the crowd but since then his photograph and a full description of him have been circulated in every newspaper and nobody has been able to give any news of him we have of course received many letters from all over england but each clue so far has ended in disappointment on monday morning a further sensational discovery came to light behind a portire in mr davenheims study stands a safe and that safe had been broken into and rifled the windows were fastened securely on the inside which seems to put an ordinary burglary out of court unless of course an accomplice within the house fastened them again afterwards on the other hand sunday having intervened and the household being in a state of chaos it is likely that the burglary was committed on the saturday and remained undetected until monday prcisment said poirot dryly well is he arrested ce pauvre m lowen japp grinned not yet but hes under pretty close supervision poirot nodded what was taken from the safe have you any idea weve been going into that with the junior partner of the firm and mrs davenheim apparently there was a considerable amount in bearer bonds and a very large sum in notes owing to some large transaction having been just carried through there was also a small fortune in jewellery all mrs davenheims jewels were kept in the safe the purchasing of them had become a passion with her husband of late years and hardly a month passed that he did not make her a present of some rare and costly gem altogether a good haul said poirot thoughtfully now what about lowen is it known what his business was with davenheim that evening well the two men were apparently not on very good terms lowen is a speculator in quite a small way nevertheless he has been able once or twice to score a coup off davenheim in the market though it seems they seldom or never actually met it was a matter concerning some south american shares which led the banker to make his appointment had davenheim interests in south america then i believe so mrs davenheim happened to mention that he spent all last autumn in buenos ayres any trouble in his home life were the husband and wife on good terms i should say his domestic life was quite peaceful and uneventful mrs davenheim is a pleasant rather unintelligent woman quite a nonentity i think then we must not look for the solution of the mystery there had he any enemies he had plenty of financial rivals and no doubt there are many people whom he has got the better of who bear him no particular goodwill but there was no one likely to make away with himand if they had where is the body exactly as hastings says bodies have a habit of coming to light with fatal persistency by the way one of the gardeners says he saw a figure going round to the side of the house toward the rosegarden the long french window of the study opens on to the rosegarden and mr davenheim frequently entered and left the house that way but the man was a good way off at work on some cucumber frames and cannot even say whether it was the figure of his master or not also he cannot fix the time with any accuracy it must have been before six as the gardeners cease work at that time and mr davenheim left the house about halfpast five or thereabouts what lies beyond the rosegarden a lake with a boathouse yes a couple of punts are kept there i suppose youre thinking of suicide monsieur poirot well i dont mind telling you that millers going down tomorrow expressly to see that piece of water dragged thats the kind of man he is poirot smiled faintly and turned to me hastings i pray you hand me that copy of the daily megaphone if i remember rightly there is an unusually clear photograph there of the missing man i rose and found the sheet required poirot studied the features attentively hm he murmured wears his hair rather long and wavy full moustache and pointed beard bushy eyebrows eyes dark yes hair and beard turning grey the detective nodded well monsieur poirot what have you got to say to it all clear as daylight eh on the contrary most obscure the scotland yard man looked pleased which gives me great hopes of solving it finished poirot placidly eh i find it a good sign when a case is obscure if a thing is clear as daylighteh bien mistrust it some one has made it so japp shook his head almost pityingly well each to their fancy but its not a bad thing to see your way clear ahead i do not see murmured poirot i shut my eyesand think japp sighed well youve got a clear week to think in and you will bring me any fresh developments that arisethe result of the labours of the hardworking and lynxeyed inspector miller for instance certainly thats in the bargain seems a shame doesnt it said japp to me as i accompanied him to the door like robbing a child i could not help agreeing with a smile i was still smiling as i reentered the room eh bien said poirot immediately you make fun of papa poirot is it not so he shook his finger at me you do not trust his grey cells ah do not be confused let us discuss this little problemincomplete as yet i admit but already showing one or two points of interest the lake i said significantly and even more than the lake the boathouse i looked sidewise at poirot he was smiling in his most inscrutable fashion i felt that for the moment it would be quite useless to question him further we heard nothing of japp until the following evening when he walked in about nine oclock i saw at once by his expression that he was bursting with news of some kind eh bien my friend remarked poirot all goes well but do not tell me that you have discovered the body of mr davenheim in your lake because i shall not believe you we havent found the body but we did find his clothesthe identical clothes he was wearing that day what do you say to that any other clothes missing from the house no his valet is quite positive on that point the rest of his wardrobe is intact theres more weve arrested lowen one of the maids whose business it is to fasten the bedroom windows declares that she saw lowen coming towards the study through the rosegarden about a quarter past six that would be about ten minutes before he left the house what does he himself say to that denied first of all that he had ever left the study but the maid was positive and he pretended afterwards that he had forgotten just stepping out of the window to examine an unusual species of rose rather a weak story and theres fresh evidence against him come to light mr davenheim always wore a thick gold ring set with a solitaire diamond on the little finger of his right hand well that ring was pawned in london on saturday night by a man called billy kellett hes already known to the policedid three months last autumn for lifting an old gentlemans watch it seems he tried to pawn the ring at no less than five different places succeeded at the last one got gloriously drunk on the proceeds assaulted a policeman and was run in in consequence i went to bow street with miller and saw him hes sober enough now and i dont mind admitting we pretty well frightened the life out of him hinting he might be charged with murder this is his yarn and a very queer one it is he was at entfield races on saturday though i dare say scarfpins was his line of business rather than betting anyway he had a bad day and was down on his luck he was tramping along the road to chingside and sat down in a ditch to rest just before he got into the village a few minutes later he noticed a man coming along the road to the village darkcomplexioned gent with a big moustache one of them city toffs is his description of the man kellett was half concealed from the road by a heap of stones just before he got abreast of him the man looked quickly up and down the road and seeing it apparently deserted he took a small object from his pocket and threw it over the hedge then he went on towards the station now the object he had thrown over the hedge had fallen with a slight chink which aroused the curiosity of the human derelict in the ditch he investigated and after a short search discovered the ring that is kelletts story its only fair to say that lowen denies it utterly and of course the word of a man like kellett cant be relied upon in the slightest its within the bounds of possibility that he met davenheim in the lane and robbed and murdered him poirot shook his head very improbable mon ami he had no means of disposing of the body it would have been found by now secondly the open way in which he pawned the ring makes it unlikely that he did murder to get it thirdly your sneakthief is rarely a murderer fourthly as he has been in prison since saturday it would be too much of a coincidence that he is able to give so accurate a description of lowen japp nodded i dont say youre not right but all the same you wont get a jury to take much note of a jailbirds evidence what seems odd to me is that lowen couldnt find a cleverer way of disposing of the ring poirot shrugged his shoulders well after all if it were found in the neighbourhood it might be argued that davenheim himself had dropped it but why remove it from the body at all i cried there might be a reason for that said japp do you know that just beyond the lake a little gate leads out on to the hill and not three minutes walk brings you towhat do you thinka lime kiln good heavens i cried you mean that the lime which destroyed the body would be powerless to affect the metal of the ring exactly it seems to me i said that that explains everything what a horrible crime by common consent we both turned and looked at poirot he seemed lost in reflection his brow knitted as though with some supreme mental effort i felt that at last his keen intellect was asserting itself what would his first words be we were not long left in doubt with a sigh the tension of his attitude relaxed and turning to japp he asked have you any idea my friend whether mr and mrs davenheim occupied the same bedroom the question seemed so ludicrously inappropriate that for a moment we both stared in silence then japp burst into a laugh good lord monsieur poirot i thought you were coming out with something startling as to your question im sure i dont know you could find out asked poirot with curious persistence oh certainlyif you really want to know merci mon ami i should be obliged if you would make a point of it japp stared at him a few minutes longer but poirot seemed to have forgotten us both the detective shook his head sadly at me and murmuring poor old fellow wars been too much for him gently withdrew from the room as poirot still seemed sunk in a daydream i took a sheet of paper and amused myself by scribbling notes upon it my friends voice aroused me he had come out of his reverie and was looking brisk and alert que faitesvous l mon ami i was jotting down what occurred to me as the main points of interest in this affair you become methodicalat last said poirot approvingly i concealed my pleasure shall i read them to you by all means i cleared my throat one all the evidence points to lowen having been the man who forced the safe two he had a grudge against davenheim three he lied in his first statement that he had never left the study four if you accept billy kelletts story as true lowen is unmistakably implicated i paused well i asked for i felt that i had put my finger on all the vital facts poirot looked at me pityingly shaking his head very gently mon pauvre ami but it is that you have not the gift the important detail you appreciate him never also your reasoning is false how let me take your four points one mr lowen could not possibly know that he would have the chance to open the safe he came for a business interview he could not know beforehand that mr davenheim would be absent posting a letter and that he would consequently be alone in the study he might have seized his opportunity i suggested and the tools city gentlemen do not carry round housebreakers tools on the off chance and one could not cut into that safe with a penknife bien entendu well what about number two you say lowen had a grudge against mr davenheim what you mean is that he had once or twice got the better of him and presumably those transactions were entered into with the view of benefiting himself in any case you do not as a rule bear a grudge against a man you have got the better ofit is more likely to be the other way about whatever grudge there might have been would have been on mr davenheims side well you cant deny that he lied about never having left the study no but he may have been frightened remember the missing mans clothes had just been discovered in the lake of course as usual he would have done better to speak the truth and the fourth point i grant you that if kelletts story is true lowen is undeniably implicated that is what makes the affair so very interesting then i did appreciate one vital fact perhapsbut you have entirely overlooked the two most important points the ones which undoubtedly hold the clue to the whole matter and pray what are they one the passion which has grown upon mr davenheim in the last few years for buying jewellery two his trip to buenos ayres last autumn poirot you are joking i am most serious ah sacred thunder but i hope japp will not forget my little commission but the detective entering into the spirit of the joke had remembered it so well that a telegram was handed to poirot about eleven oclock the next day at his request i opened it and read it out husband and wife have occupied separate rooms since last winter aha cried poirot and now we are in mid june all is solved i stared at him you have no moneys in the bank of davenheim and salmon mon ami no i said wondering why because i should advise you to withdraw itbefore it is too late why what do you expect i expect a big smash in a few daysperhaps sooner which reminds me we will return the compliment of a dpche to japp a pencil i pray you and a form voil advise you to withdraw any money deposited with firm in question that will intrigue him the good japp his eyes will open widewide he will not comprehend in the slightestuntil tomorrow or the next day i remained sceptical but the morrow forced me to render tribute to my friends remarkable powers in every paper was a huge headline telling of the sensational failure of the davenheim bank the disappearance of the famous financier took on a totally different aspect in the light of the revelation of the financial affairs of the bank before we were halfway through breakfast the door flew open and japp rushed in in his left hand was a paper in his right was poirots telegram which he banged down on the table in front of my friend how did you know monsieur poirot how the blazes could you know poirot smiled placidly at him ah mon ami after your wire it was a certainty from the commencement see you it struck me that the safe burglary was somewhat remarkable jewels ready money bearer bondsall so conveniently arranged forwhom well the good monsieur davenheim was of those who look after number one as your saying goes it seemed almost certain that it was arranged forhimself then his passion of late years for buying jewellery how simple the funds he embezzled he converted into jewels very likely replacing them in turn with paste duplicates and so he put away in a safe place under another name a considerable fortune to be enjoyed all in good time when every one has been thrown off the track his arrangements completed he makes an appointment with mr lowen who has been imprudent enough in the past to cross the great man once or twice drills a hole in the safe leaves orders that the guest is to be shown into the study and walks out of the housewhere poirot stopped and stretched out his hand for another boiled egg he frowned it is really insupportable he murmured that every hen lays an egg of a different size what symmetry can there be on the breakfast table at least they should sort them in dozens at the shop never mind the eggs said japp impatiently let em lay em square if they like tell us where our customer went to when he left the cedarsthat is if you know eh bien he went to his hidingplace ah this monsieur davenheim there may be some malformation in his grey cells but they are of the first quality do you know where he is hiding certainly it is most ingenious for the lords sake tell us then poirot gently collected every fragment of shell from his plate placed them in the eggcup and reversed the empty eggshell on top of them this little operation concluded he smiled on the neat effect and then beamed affectionately on us both come my friends you are men of intelligence ask yourselves the question which i asked myself if i were this man where should i hide hastings what do you say well i said im rather inclined to think id not do a bolt at all id stay in londonin the heart of things travel by tubes and buses ten to one id never be recognized theres safety in a crowd poirot turned inquiringly to japp i dont agree get clear away at oncethats the only chance i would have had plenty of time to prepare things beforehand id have a yacht waiting with steam up and id be off to one of the most outoftheway corners of the world before the hue and cry began we both looked at poirot what do you say monsieur for a moment he remained silent then a very curious smile flitted across his face my friends if i were hiding from the police do you know where i should hide in a prison what you are seeking monsieur davenheim in order to put him in prison so you never dream of looking to see if he may not be already there what do you mean you tell me madame davenheim is not a very intelligent woman nevertheless i think that if you took her to bow street and confronted her with the man billy kellett she would recognize him in spite of the fact that he has shaved his beard and moustache and those bushy eyebrows and has cropped his hair close a woman nearly always knows her husband though the rest of the world may be deceived billy kellett but hes known to the police did i not tell you davenheim was a clever man he prepared his alibi long beforehand he was not in buenos ayres last autumnhe was creating the character of billy kellett doing three months so that the police should have no suspicions when the time came he was playing remember for a large fortune as well as liberty it was worth while doing the thing thoroughly only yes eh bien afterwards he had to wear a false beard and wig had to make up as himself again and to sleep with a false beard is not easyit invites detection he cannot risk continuing to share the chamber of madame his wife you found out for me that for the last six months or ever since his supposed return from buenos ayres he and mrs davenheim occupied separate rooms then i was sure everything fitted in the gardener who fancied he saw his master going round to the side of the house was quite right he went to the boathouse donned his tramp clothes which you may be sure had been safely hidden from the eyes of his valet dropped the others in the lake and proceeded to carry out his plan by pawning the ring in an obvious manner and then assaulting a policeman getting himself safely into the haven of bow street where nobody would ever dream of looking for him its impossible murmured japp ask madame said my friend smiling the next day a registered letter lay beside poirots plate he opened it and a fivepound note fluttered out my friends brow puckered ah sacr but what shall i do with it i have much remorse ce pauvre japp ah an idea we will have a little dinner we three that consoles me it was really too easy i am ashamed i who would not rob a childmille tonnerres mon ami what have you that you laugh so heartily   x   the adventure of the italian nobleman poirot and i had many friends and acquaintances of an informal nature amongst these was to be numbered dr hawker a near neighbour of ours and a member of the medical profession it was the genial doctors habit to drop in sometimes of an evening and have a chat with poirot of whose genius he was an ardent admirer the doctor himself frank and unsuspicious to the last degree admired the talents so far removed from his own on one particular evening in early june he arrived about halfpast eight and settled down to a comfortable discussion on the cheery topic of the prevalence of arsenical poisoning in crimes it must have been about a quarter of an hour later when the door of our sittingroom flew open and a distracted female precipitated herself into the room oh doctor youre wanted such a terrible voice it gave me a turn it did indeed i recognized in our new visitor dr hawkers housekeeper miss rider the doctor was a bachelor and lived in a gloomy old house a few streets away the usually placid miss rider was now in a state bordering on incoherence what terrible voice who is it and whats the trouble it was the telephone doctor i answered itand a voice spoke help it said doctorhelp theyve killed me then it sort of tailed away whos speaking i said whos speaking then i got a reply just a whisper it seemed foscatinesomething like thatregents court the doctor uttered an exclamation count foscatini he has a flat in regents court i must go at once what can have happened a patient of yours asked poirot i attended him for some slight ailment a few weeks ago an italian but he speaks english perfectly well i must wish you good night monsieur poirot unless he hesitated i perceive the thought in your mind said poirot smiling i shall be delighted to accompany you hastings run down and get hold of a taxi taxis always make themselves sought for when one is particularly pressed for time but i captured one at last and we were soon bowling along in the direction of regents park regents court was a new block of flats situated just off st johns wood road they had only recently been built and contained the latest service devices there was no one in the hall the doctor pressed the liftbell impatiently and when the lift arrived questioned the uniformed attendant sharply flat ii count foscatini theres been an accident there i understand the man stared at him first ive heard of it mr gravesthats count foscatinis manwent out about half an hour ago and he said nothing is the count alone in the flat no sir hes got two gentlemen dining with him what are they like i asked eagerly we were in the lift now ascending rapidly to the second floor on which flat ii was situated i didnt see them myself sir but i understand that they were foreign gentlemen he pulled back the iron door and we stepped out on the landing no ii was opposite to us the doctor rang the bell there was no reply and we could hear no sound from within the doctor rang again and again we could hear the bell trilling within but no sign of life rewarded us this is getting serious muttered the doctor he turned to the lift attendant is there any passkey to this door there is one in the porters office downstairs get it then and look here i think youd better send for the police poirot approved with a nod of the head the man returned shortly with him came the manager will you tell me gentlemen what is the meaning of all this certainly i received a telephone message from count foscatini stating that he had been attacked and was dying you can understand that we must lose no timeif we are not already too late the manager produced the key without more ado and we all entered the flat we passed first into a small square lounge hall a door on the right of it was half open the manager indicated it with a nod the diningroom dr hawker led the way we followed close on his heels as we entered the room i gave a gasp the round table in the centre bore the remains of a meal three chairs were pushed back as though their occupants had just risen in the corner to the right of the fireplace was a big writingtable and sitting at it was a manor what had been a man his right hand still grasped the base of the telephone but he had fallen forward struck down by a terrific blow on the head from behind the weapon was not far to seek a marble statuette stood where it had been hurriedly put down the base of it stained with blood the doctors examination did not take a minute stone dead must have been almost instantaneous i wonder he even managed to telephone it will be better not to move him until the police arrive on the managers suggestion we searched the flat but the result was a foregone conclusion it was not likely that the murderers would be concealed there when all they had to do was to walk out we came back to the diningroom poirot had not accompanied us in our tour i found him studying the centre table with close attention i joined him it was a wellpolished round mahogany table a bowl of roses decorated the centre and white lace mats reposed on the gleaming surface there was a dish of fruit but the three dessert plates were untouched there were three coffeecups with remains of coffee in themtwo black one with milk all three men had taken port and the decanter halffull stood before the centre plate one of the men had smoked a cigar the other two cigarettes a tortoiseshellandsilver box holding cigars and cigarettes stood open upon the table i enumerated all these facts to myself but i was forced to admit that they did not shed any brilliant light on the situation i wondered what poirot saw in them to make him so intent i asked him mon ami he replied you miss the point i am looking for something that i do not see what is that a mistakeeven a little mistakeon the part of the murderer he stepped swiftly to the small adjoining kitchen looked in and shook his head monsieur he said to the manager explain to me i pray your system of serving meals here the manager stepped to a small hatch in the wall this is the service lift he explained it runs to the kitchens at the top of the building you order through this telephone and the dishes are sent down in the lift one course at a time the dirty plates and dishes are sent up in the same manner no domestic worries you understand and at the same time you avoid the wearying publicity of always dining in a restaurant poirot nodded then the plates and dishes that were used tonight are on high in the kitchen you permit that i mount there oh certainly if you like roberts the lift man will take you up and introduce you but im afraid you wont find anything thats of any use theyre handling hundreds of plates and dishes and theyll be all lumped together poirot remained firm however and together we visited the kitchens and questioned the man who had taken the order from flat ii the order was given from the  la carte menufor three he explained soup julienne filet de sole normande tournedos of beef and a rice souffl what time just about eight oclock i should say no im afraid the plates and dishes have been all washed up by now unfortunate you were thinking of fingerprints i suppose not exactly said poirot with an enigmatical smile i am more interested in count foscatinis appetite did he partake of every dish yes but of course i cant say how much of each he ate the plates were all soiled and the dishes emptythat is to say with the exception of the rice souffl there was a fair amount of that left ah said poirot and seemed satisfied with the fact as we descended to the flat again he remarked in a low tone we have decidedly to do with a man of method do you mean the murderer or count foscatini the latter was undoubtedly an orderly gentleman after imploring help and announcing his approaching demise he carefully hung up the telephone receiver i stared at poirot his words now and his recent inquiries gave me the glimmering of an idea you suspect poison i breathed the blow on the head was a blind poirot merely smiled we reentered the flat to find the local inspector of police had arrived with two constables he was inclined to resent our appearance but poirot calmed him with the mention of our scotland yard friend inspector japp and we were accorded a grudging permission to remain it was a lucky thing we were for we had not been back five minutes before an agitated middleaged man came rushing into the room with every appearance of grief and agitation this was graves valetbutler to the late count foscatini the story he had to tell was a sensational one on the previous morning two gentlemen had called to see his master they were italians and the elder of the two a man of about forty gave his name as signor ascanio the younger was a welldressed lad of about twentyfour count foscatini was evidently prepared for their visit and immediately sent graves out upon some trivial errand here the man paused and hesitated in his story in the end however he admitted that curious as to the purport of the interview he had not obeyed immediately but had lingered about endeavouring to hear something of what was going on the conversation was carried on in so low a tone that he was not as successful as he had hoped but he gathered enough to make it clear that some kind of monetary proposition was being discussed and that the basis of it was a threat the discussion was anything but amicable in the end count foscatini raised his voice slightly and the listener heard these words clearly i have no time to argue further now gentlemen if you will dine with me tomorrow night at eight oclock we will resume the discussion afraid of being discovered listening graves had then hurried out to do his masters errand this evening the two men had arrived punctually at eight during dinner they had talked of indifferent matterspolitics the weather and the theatrical world when graves had placed the port upon the table and brought in the coffee his master told him that he might have the evening off was that a usual proceeding of his when he had guests asked the inspector no sir it wasnt thats what made me think it must be some business of a very unusual kind that he was going to discuss with these gentlemen that finished gravess story he had gone out about  and meeting a friend had accompanied him to the metropolitan music hall in edgware road nobody had seen the two men leave but the time of the murder was fixed clearly enough at  a small clock on the writingtable had been swept off by foscatinis arm and had stopped at that hour which agreed with miss riders telephone summons the police surgeon had made his examination of the body and it was now lying on the couch i saw the face for the first timethe olive complexion the long nose the luxuriant black moustache and the full red lips drawn back from the dazzlingly white teeth not altogether a pleasant face well said the inspector refastening his notebook the case seems clear enough the only difficulty will be to lay our hands on this signor ascanio i suppose his address is not in the dead mans pocketbook by any chance as poirot had said the late foscatini was an orderly man neatly written in small precise handwriting was the inscription signor paolo ascanio grosvenor hotel the inspector busied himself with the telephone then turned to us with a grin just in time our fine gentleman was off to catch the boat train to the continong well gentlemen thats about all we can do here its a bad business but straightforward enough one of these italian vendetta things as likely as not thus airily dismissed we found our way downstairs dr hawker was full of excitement like the beginning of a novel eh real exciting stuff wouldnt believe it if you read about it poirot did not speak he was very thoughtful all the evening he had hardly opened his lips what says the master detective eh asked hawker clapping him on the back nothing to work your grey cells over this time you think not what could there be well for example there is the window the window but it was fastened nobody could have got out or in that way i noticed it specially and why were you able to notice it the doctor looked puzzled poirot hastened to explain it is to the curtains i refer they were not drawn a little odd that and then there was the coffee it was very black coffee well what of it very black repeated poirot in conjunction with that let us remember that very little of the rice souffl was eaten and we getwhat moonshine laughed the doctor youre pulling my leg never do i pull the leg hastings here knows that i am perfectly serious i dont know what you are getting at all the same i confessed you dont suspect the manservant do you he might have been in with the gang and put some dope in the coffee i suppose theyll test his alibi without doubt my friend but it is the alibi of signor ascanio that interests me you think he has an alibi that is just what worries me i have no doubt that we shall soon be enlightened on that point the daily newsmonger enabled us to become conversant with succeeding events signor ascanio was arrested and charged with the murder of count foscatini when arrested he denied knowing the count and declared he had never been near regents court either on the evening of the crime or on the previous morning the younger man had disappeared entirely signor ascanio had arrived alone at the grosvenor hotel from the continent two days before the murder all efforts to trace the second man failed ascanio however was not sent for trial no less a personage than the italian ambassador himself came forward and testified at the policecourt proceedings that ascanio had been with him at the embassy from eight till nine that evening the prisoner was discharged naturally a lot of people thought that the crime was a political one and was being deliberately hushed up poirot had taken a keen interest in all these points nevertheless i was somewhat surprised when he suddenly informed me one morning that he was expecting a visitor at eleven oclock and that that visitor was none other than ascanio himself he wishes to consult you du tout hastings i wish to consult him what about the regents court murder you are going to prove that he did it a man cannot be tried twice for murder hastings endeavour to have the common sense ah that is our friends ring a few minutes later signor ascanio was ushered ina small thin man with a secretive and furtive glance in his eyes he remained standing darting suspicious glances from one to the other of us monsieur poirot my little friend tapped himself gently on the chest be seated signor you received my note i am determined to get to the bottom of this mystery in some small measure you can aid me let us commence youin company with a friendvisited the late count foscatini on the morning of tuesday the th the italian made an angry gesture i did nothing of the sort i have sworn in court prcismentand i have a little idea that you have sworn falsely you threaten me bah i have nothing to fear from you i have been acquitted exactly and as i am not an imbecile it is not with the gallows i threaten youbut with publicity publicity i see that you do not like the word i had an idea that you would not my little ideas you know they are very valuable to me come signor your only chance is to be frank with me i do not ask to know whose indiscretions brought you to england i know this much you came for the especial purpose of seeing count foscatini he was not a count growled the italian i have already noted the fact that his name does not appear in the almanach de gotha never mind the title of count is often useful in the profession of blackmailing i suppose i might as well be frank you seem to know a good deal i have employed my grey cells to some advantage come signor ascanio you visited the dead man on the tuesday morningthat is so is it not yes but i never went there on the following evening there was no need i will tell you all certain information concerning a man of great position in italy had come into this scoundrels possession he demanded a big sum of money in return for the papers i came over to england to arrange the matter i called upon him by appointment that morning one of the young secretaries of the embassy was with me the count was more reasonable than i had hoped although even then the sum of money i paid him was a huge one pardon how was it paid in italian notes of comparatively small denomination i paid over the money then and there he handed me the incriminating papers i never saw him again why did you not say all this when you were arrested in my delicate position i was forced to deny any association with the man and how do you account for the events of the evening then i can only think that some one must have deliberately impersonated me i understand that no money was found in the flat poirot looked at him and shook his head strange he murmured we all have the little grey cells and so few of us know how to use them good morning signor ascanio i believe your story it is very much as i had imagined but i had to make sure after bowing his guest out poirot returned to his armchair and smiled at me let us hear m le capitaine hastings on the case well i suppose ascanio is rightsomebody impersonated him never never will you use the brains the good god has given you recall to yourself some words i uttered after leaving the flat that night i referred to the windowcurtains not being drawn we are in the month of june it is still light at eight oclock the light is failing by halfpast a vous dit quelque chose i perceive a struggling impression that you will arrive some day now let us continue the coffee was as i said very black count foscatinis teeth were magnificently white coffee stains the teeth we reason from that that count foscatini did not drink any coffee yet there was coffee in all three cups why should anyone pretend count foscatini had drunk coffee when he had not done so i shook my head utterly bewildered come i will help you what evidence have we that ascanio and his friend or two men posing as them ever came to the flat that night nobody saw them go in nobody saw them go out we have the evidence of one man and of a host of inanimate objects you mean i mean knives and forks and plates and empty dishes ah but it was a clever idea graves is a thief and a scoundrel but what a man of method he overhears a portion of the conversation in the morning enough to realize that ascanio will be in awkward position to defend himself the following evening about eight oclock he tells his master he is wanted at the telephone foscatini sits down stretches out his hand to the telephone and from behind graves strikes him down with the marble figure then quickly to the service telephonedinner for three it comes he lays the table dirties the plates knives and forks etc but he has to get rid of the food too not only is he a man of brain he has a resolute and capacious stomach but after eating three tournedos the rice souffl is too much for him he even smokes a cigar and two cigarettes to carry out the illusion ah but it was magnificently thorough then having moved on the hands of the clock to  he smashes it and stops it the one thing he does not do is to draw the curtains but if there had been a real dinner party the curtains would have been drawn as soon as the light began to fail then he hurries out mentioning the guests to the lift man in passing he hurries to a telephone box and as near as possible to  rings up the doctor with his masters dying cry so successful is his idea that no one ever inquires if a call was put through from flat ii at that time except hercule poirot i suppose i said sarcastically not even hercule poirot said my friend with a smile i am about to inquire now i had to prove my point to you first but you will see i shall be right and then japp to whom i have already given a hint will be able to arrest the respectable graves i wonder how much of the money he has spent poirot was right he always is confound him   xi   the case of the missing will the problem presented to us by miss violet marsh made rather a pleasant change from our usual routine work poirot had received a brisk and businesslike note from the lady asking for an appointment and he had replied asking her to call upon him at eleven oclock the following day she arrived punctuallya tall handsome young woman plainly but neatly dressed with an assured and businesslike manner clearly a young woman who meant to get on in the world i am not a great admirer of the socalled new woman myself and in spite of her good looks i was not particularly prepossessed in her favour my business is of a somewhat unusual nature monsieur poirot she began after she had accepted a chair i had better begin at the beginning and tell you the whole story if you please mademoiselle i am an orphan my father was one of two brothers sons of a small yeoman farmer in devonshire the farm was a poor one and the elder brother andrew emigrated to australia where he did very well indeed and by means of successful speculation in land became a very rich man the younger brother roger my father had no leanings towards the agricultural life he managed to educate himself a little and obtained a post as a clerk with a small firm he married slightly above him my mother was the daughter of a poor artist my father died when i was six years old when i was fourteen my mother followed him to the grave my only living relation then was my uncle andrew who had recently returned from australia and bought a small place crabtree manor in his native county he was exceedingly kind to his brothers orphan child took me to live with him and treated me in every way as though i was his own daughter crabtree manor in spite of its name is really only an old farmhouse farming was in my uncles blood and he was intensely interested in various modern farming experiments although kindness itself to me he had certain peculiar and deeplyrooted ideas as to the upbringing of women himself a man of little or no education though possessing remarkable shrewdness he placed little value on what he called book knowledge he was especially opposed to the education of women in his opinion girls should learn practical housework and dairywork be useful about the home and have as little to do with book learning as possible he proposed to bring me up on these lines to my bitter disappointment and annoyance i rebelled frankly i knew that i possessed a good brain and had absolutely no talent for domestic duties my uncle and i had many bitter arguments on the subject for though much attached to each other we were both selfwilled i was lucky enough to win a scholarship and up to a certain point was successful in getting my own way the crisis arose when i resolved to go to girton i had a little money of my own left me by my mother and i was quite determined to make the best use of the gifts god had given me i had one long final argument with my uncle he put the facts plainly before me he had no other relations and he had intended me to be his sole heiress as i have told you he was a very rich man if i persisted in these newfangled notions of mine however i need look for nothing from him i remained polite but firm i should always be deeply attached to him i told him but i must lead my own life we parted on that note you fancy your brains my girl were his last words ive no book learning but for all that ill pit mine against yours any day well see what we shall see that was nine years ago i have stayed with him for a weekend occasionally and our relations were perfectly amicable though his views remained unaltered he never referred to my having matriculated nor to my bsc for the last three years his health had been failing and a month ago he died i am now coming to the point of my visit my uncle left a most extraordinary will by its terms crabtree manor and its contents are to be at my disposal for a year from his deathduring which time my clever niece may prove her wits the actual words run at the end of that period my wits having proved better than hers the house and all my uncles large fortune pass to various charitable institutions that is a little hard on you mademoiselle seeing that you were mr marshs only blood relation i do not look on it in that way uncle andrew warned me fairly and i chose my own path since i would not fall in with his wishes he was at perfect liberty to leave his money to whom he pleased was the will drawn up by a lawyer no it was written on a printed willform and witnessed by the man and his wife who live in the house and do for my uncle there might be a possibility of upsetting such a will i would not even attempt to do such a thing you regard it then as a sporting challenge on the part of your uncle that is exactly how i look upon it it bears that interpretation certainly said poirot thoughtfully somewhere in this rambling old manorhouse your uncle has concealed either a sum of money in notes or possibly a second will and has given you a year in which to exercise your ingenuity to find it exactly monsieur poirot and i am paying you the compliment of assuming that your ingenuity will be greater than mine eh eh but that is very charming of you my grey cells are at your disposal you have made no search yourself only a cursory one but i have too much respect for my uncles undoubted abilities to fancy that the task will be an easy one have you the will or a copy of it with you miss marsh handed a document across the table poirot ran through it nodding to himself made three years ago dated march  and the time is given also amthat is very suggestive it narrows the field of search assuredly it is another will we have to seek for a will made even halfanhour later would upset this eh bien mademoiselle it is a problem charming and ingenious that you have presented to me here i shall have all the pleasure in the world in solving it for you granted that your uncle was a man of ability his grey cells cannot have been of the quality of hercule poirots really poirots vanity is blatant fortunately i have nothing of moment on hand at the minute hastings and i will go down to crabtree manor tonight the man and wife who attended on your uncle are still there i presume yes their name is baker                      the following morning saw us started on the hunt proper we had arrived late the night before mr and mrs baker having received a telegram from miss marsh were expecting us they were a pleasant couple the man gnarled and pinkcheeked like a shrivelled pippin and his wife a woman of vast proportions and true devonshire calm tired with our journey and the eightmile drive from the station we had retired at once to bed after a supper of roast chicken apple pie and devonshire cream we had now disposed of an excellent breakfast and were sitting in a small panelled room which had been the late mr marshs study and livingroom a rolltop desk stuffed with papers all neatly docketed stood against the wall and a big leather armchair showed plainly that it had been its owners constant restingplace a big chintzcovered settee ran along the opposite wall and the deep low window seats were covered with the same faded chintz of an oldfashioned pattern eh bien mon ami said poirot lighting one of his tiny cigarettes we must map out our plan of campaign already i have made a rough survey of the house but i am of opinion that any clue will be found in this room we shall have to go through the documents in the desk with meticulous care naturally i do not expect to find the will amongst them but it is likely that some apparently innocent paper may conceal the clue to its hidingplace but first we must have a little information ring the bell i pray of you i did so while we were waiting for it to be answered poirot walked up and down looking about him approvingly a man of method this mr marsh see how neatly the packets of papers are docketed then the key to each drawer has its ivory labelso has the key of the china cabinet on the wall and see with what precision the china within is arranged it rejoices the heart nothing here offends the eye he came to an abrupt pause as his eye was caught by the key of the desk itself to which a dirty envelope was affixed poirot frowned at it and withdrew it from the lock on it were scrawled the words key of roll top desk in a crabbed handwriting quite unlike the neat superscriptions on the other keys an alien note said poirot frowning i could swear that here we have no longer the personality of mr marsh but who else has been in the house only miss marsh and she if i mistake not is also a young lady of method and order baker came in answer to the bell will you fetch madame your wife and answer a few questions baker departed and in a few moments returned with mrs baker wiping her hands on her apron and beaming all over her face in a few clear words poirot set forth the object of his mission the bakers were immediately sympathetic us dont want to see miss violet done out of whats hers declared the woman cruel hard twould be for hospitals to get it all poirot proceeded with his questions yes mr and mrs baker remembered perfectly witnessing the will baker had previously been sent into the neighbouring town to get two printed willforms two said poirot sharply yes sir for safety like i suppose in case he should spoil oneand sure enough so he did do us had signed one what time of day was that baker scratched his head but his wife was quicker why to be sure id just put the milk on for the cocoa at eleven dont ee remember it had all boiled over on the stove when us got back to kitchen and afterwards twould be about an hour later us had to go in again ive made a mistake says old master had to tear the whole thing up ill trouble you to sign again and us did and afterwards master give us a tidy sum of money each ive left you nothing in my will says he but each year i live youll have this to be a nestegg when im gone and sure enough so he did poirot reflected after you had signed the second time what did mr marsh do do you know went out to the village to pay tradesmens books that did not seem very promising poirot tried another tack he held out the key of the desk is that your masters writing i may have imagined it but i fancied that a moment or two elapsed before baker replied yes sir it is hes lying i thought but why has your master let the househave there been any strangers in it during the last three years no sir no visitors only miss violet no strangers of any kind been inside this room no sir you forget the workmen jim his wife reminded him workmen poirot wheeled round on her what workmen the woman explained that about two years and a half ago workmen had been in the house to do certain repairs she was quite vague as to what the repairs were her view seemed to be that the whole thing was a fad of her masters and quite unnecessary part of the time the workmen had been in the study but what they had done there she could not say as her master had not let either of them into the room whilst the work was in progress unfortunately they could not remember the name of the firm employed beyond the fact that it was a plymouth one we progress hastings said poirot rubbing his hands as the bakers left the room clearly he made a second will and then had workmen from plymouth in to make a suitable hidingplace instead of wasting time taking up the floor and tapping the walls we will go to plymouth with a little trouble we were able to get the information we wanted after one or two essays we found the firm employed by mr marsh their employees had all been with them many years and it was easy to find the two men who had worked under mr marshs orders they remembered the job perfectly amongst various other minor jobs they had taken up one of the bricks of the oldfashioned fireplace made a cavity beneath and so cut the brick that it was impossible to see the join by pressing on the second brick from the end the whole thing was raised it had been quite a complicated piece of work and the old gentleman had been very fussy about it our informant was a man called coghan a big gaunt man with a grizzled moustache he seemed an intelligent fellow we returned to crabtree manor in high spirits and locking the study door proceeded to put our newly acquired knowledge into effect it was impossible to see any sign on the bricks but when we pressed in the manner indicated a deep cavity was at once disclosed eagerly poirot plunged in his hand suddenly his face fell from complacent elation to consternation all he held was a charred fragment of stiff paper but for it the cavity was empty sacr cried poirot angrily some one has been before us we examined the scrap of paper anxiously clearly it was a fragment of what we sought a portion of bakers signature remained but no indication of what the terms of the will had been poirot sat back on his heels his expression would have been comical if we had not been so overcome i understand it not he growled who destroyed this and what was their object the bakers i suggested pourquoi neither will makes any provision for them and they are more likely to be kept on with miss marsh than if the place became the property of a hospital how could it be to anyones advantage to destroy the will the hospitals benefityes but one cannot suspect institutions perhaps the old man changed his mind and destroyed it himself i suggested poirot rose to his feet dusting his knees with his usual care that may be he admitted one of your more sensible observations hastings well we can do no more here we have done all that mortal man can do we have successfully pitted our wits against the late andrew marshs but unfortunately his niece is no better off for our success by driving to the station at once we were just able to catch a train to london though not the principal express poirot was sad and dissatisfied for my part i was tired and dozed in a corner suddenly as we were just moving out of taunton poirot uttered a piercing squeal vite hastings awake and jump but jump i say before i knew where i was we were standing on the platform bareheaded and minus our valises whilst the train disappeared into the night i was furious but poirot paid no attention imbecile that i have been he cried triple imbecile not again will i vaunt my little grey cells thats a good job at any rate i said grumpily but what is this all about as usual when following out his own ideas poirot paid absolutely no attention to me the tradesmens booksi have left them entirely out of account yes but where where never mind i cannot be mistaken we must return at once easier said than done we managed to get a slow train to exeter and there poirot hired a car we arrived back at crabtree manor in the small hours of the morning i pass over the bewilderment of the bakers when we had at last aroused them paying no attention to anybody poirot strode at once to the study i have been not a triple imbecile but thirtysix times one my friend he deigned to remark now behold going straight to the desk he drew out the key and detached the envelope from it i stared at him stupidly how could he possibly hope to find a big willform in that tiny envelope with great care he cut open the envelope laying it out flat then he lighted the fire and held the plain inside surface of the envelope to the flame in a few minutes faint characters began to appear look mon ami cried poirot in triumph i looked there were just a few lines of faint writing stating briefly that he left everything to his niece violet marsh it was dated march   pm and witnessed by albert pike confectioner and jessie pike married woman but is it legal i gasped as far as i know there is no law against writing your will in a blend of disappearing and sympathetic ink the intention of the testator is clear and the beneficiary is his only living relation but the cleverness of him he foresaw every step that a searcher would takethat i miserable imbecile took he gets two willforms makes the servants sign twice then sallies out with his will written on the inside of a dirty envelope and a fountainpen containing his little ink mixture on some excuse he gets the confectioner and his wife to sign their names under his own signature then he ties it to the key of his desk and chuckles to himself if his niece sees through his little ruse she will have justified her choice of life and elaborate education and be thoroughly welcome to his money she didnt see through it did she i said slowly it seems rather unfair the old man really won but no hastings it is your wits that go astray miss marsh proved the astuteness of her wits and the value of the higher education for women by at once putting the matter in my hands always employ the expert she has amply proved her right to the money i wonderi very much wonderwhat old andrew marsh would have thought   the end end of the project gutenberg ebook
