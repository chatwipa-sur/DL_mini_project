## Task Descriptions
### **Task 1: Using an Existing Model (CycleGAN) [30%]**
The goal of this task is to train a **CycleGAN model** to perform image style transfer between **human faces and cats/dogs**.

---
### **Task 2: Fine-Grained Classification [35%]**
This task involves training a deep learning model for **fine-grained bird species classification** using the **CUB-200-2011 dataset**.

---
### **Task 3: Word-Level Language Model [35%]**
Train a RNN model using text from **Agatha Christie's book, *Poirot Investigates***.
